## Current Version
The current released version is `v0.1.0`. This is the initial release for the project.  
`v0.1.0` Adds 365 lore pages covering all the items seen in `Risk of Rain 2` and `Risk of Rain Returns`.  
For all changes, see the [Changelog](https://github.com/Sad-AI-dev/Project_Petrichor/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).  

### Roadmap
- `v0.2.0` is the next planned major release, which will include pages for all enemies seen in `Risk of Rain 2` and `Risk of Rain Returns`.  
A preview for this content can be found in the `Creatures` canvas page.  

- `v0.3.0` will be focused on adding all of the locations seen across the franchise.  

- `v0.4.0` will add lore pages for all the drones and survivors.  

The ultimate goal of the project is to create a TTRPG setting that matches the lore as faithfully as possible.  
Once all lore pages have been added to the *Obsidian* vault has been completed, work will start on adapting the setting to a TTRPG system.  
The candidates for which TTRPG system the project will be adapted to are *D&D 5th edition* and *Daggerheart*.  
However, The final product should prove useful to anyone seeking to adapt the setting.

### 1. Install Obsidian
**Project Petrichor** was created in *Obsidian* and is therefore also best viewed through *Obsidian*.  
*Obsidian* is a free note taking app and can be installed through their [official page](https://obsidian.md/).

### 2. Download latest release.

The file can be found on [this](https://github.com/Sad-AI-dev/Project_Petrichor/releases/tag/v0.1.0) page.

### 3. Unzip the file
It is recommended to place the `.zip` file in an empty folder before unzipping.

![Obsidian open vault interface](ReadMeRefs/imgs/ObsidianVaultInterface.PNG?raw=true)

If *Obsidian* has been opened before, or the Vault interface doesn't show,  
follow the instuctions on the *Obsidian* help page for opening a new vault, which can be found [here](https://help.obsidian.md/manage-vaults#Create+new+vault).

## Troubleshooting
Below are some steps that can be followed in case something goes awry in the setup process.

### The project doesn't look the same as the preview images when opened in Obsidian
The issue is likely caused by *Obsidian* not correctly linking the `CSS Snippits` used to style to project.  
To fix this issue navigate to the `Appearance` tab in the settings of *Obsidian*.  
Scoll all the way to the bottom, and a section similar to the one shown below should come into view:
![Obsidian appearance settings](ReadMeRefs/imgs/ObsidianSnippets.PNG?raw=true)

If the files are shown, but the toggles highlighted in **red** are disabled, click them to enable the styling.  
If the files are **not** shows, click the button highlighted in **blue**.  
An explorer window should appear. Navigate to `[name of folder the project was unzipped in]/.obsidian/snippets`.  
Select the `colors.css` and `ror2.css`. They should now appear in *Obsidian*.
