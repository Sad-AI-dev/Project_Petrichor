This log is a translated message received on `12/02/2056`.
The original format of the message is listed as `Universal Morse Hyper-Acoustic`.
The message was send by [[Aurelionite]] from within the [[Gilded Coast]].

This message was send before the one seen in the [[Halcyonite]] log.

The message establishes that the followers of [[Aurelionite]] donate rare metals at the `Altars of Gold` seen during gameplay.

[[Aurelionite]] goes on the threaten her creators: [[Providence]] and [[Mithrix]]. Additionally, she notes that she is `free`. However, the [[Halcyonite]] log shows that months later she is still trapped within the [[Gilded Coast]] suggesting that this freedom is fairly limited. 
This could be the time at which [[Aurelionite]] gained the ability to communicate with the world outside her realm.

Visually, [[Aurelionite]] resembles the [[Stone Titan]].
