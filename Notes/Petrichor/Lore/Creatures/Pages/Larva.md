This is the logbook entry of D. Furthen, naturalist for the UES [Redacted] in conjunction with the UES Research and Documentation of Outer Life. I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.

---------------------

We've just found a great example of the diverse lifestyles of outer life! Analyzing the life cycles of these creatures will certainly be a fun endeavor. I have assigned their common name as "Forhamian Acid Tick."

* The Ticks' biology is dominated by a bile sac, which not only stores acidic bile but also houses their eggs.

* When threatened, the Ticks produce bile at an accelerated rate, filling their bile sacs to burst - literally. I've noted some specimens capable of producing blasts of acid with a range of up to 3 meters in diameter.

* When they burst, their acid provides an avenue for newly hatched larvae to bury into prey and feast on their nutrient-rich meat.

* Their acute senses prevent predators from sneaking up on them. On top of this, the creatures exhibit automimicry, their false head spewing acidic bile onto would-be attackers, leaving enough time for the Tick to escape.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is an entry from the logbook created by [[D. Furthen & Tharson]], who were aboard the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED],]] generated by the [[DataScraper (v3.1.53 - beta branch)]] program.

The common name of the [[Larva]] is `Forhamian Acid Tick`.

The bile sac holding the acid also houses the [[Larva|Larva's]] eggs. When threatened, the ticks will start to rapidly generate acidic bile, resulting in it bursting, with an observed blast range of up to one and a half meters.
During this blast, the eggs hatch, shooting the newly hatched larvae to bury into any nearby target, allowing them to feast on the nutrient-rich meat of the target.

The [[Larva]] has an excellent sense of smell, making it hard to sneak up on.
