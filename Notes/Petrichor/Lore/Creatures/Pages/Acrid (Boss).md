[[Acrid]] can be found as a boss encounter in [[Sunken Tomb]] inside of a metal cage.
This metal cage was being shipped by the [[UES Contact Light]].

[[Acrid]] is a unique creature, therefore, because it appears in the [[Void Fields]] in Risk of Rain Returns, it can safely be assumed that [[Acrid]] ends up escaping from the metal cage. It is possible that [[Acrid]] was freed by another survivor.

During gameplay, after freeing [[Acrid]], they act aggressively towards the survivor that saved them. [[Acrid]] being free, but remaining on [[Petrichor V]] by the ends of the events of the [[UES Contact Light]] suggests that [[Acrid]] may have killed the survivor that freed them, or they escaped by themselves.
Regardless, [[Acrid]] did not make it to the wreckage of the [[UES Contact Light]].
