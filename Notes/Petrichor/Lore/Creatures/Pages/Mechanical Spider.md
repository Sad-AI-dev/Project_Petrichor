The malware of our age! These mechanical parasites were probably lurking on the ship before the crash. Pirates will use these bugs to collect especially valuable cargo, redirect transmission signals, or even hijack ships. Spiders can be programmed with all kinds of malicious objectives.

In general they are quite difficult to find and eradicate on large vessels, but now that they're loose they seem to be able to operate outside of their software. They have retained their defense capabilities, and are risky to engange. Though, I wonder, how long will they continue to run without access to an electrical grid?</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
According to [[The Survivor]], the [[Mechanical Spider]] is a common seen parasite on large space vessels. Created and placed by malicious pirates, these automata are used to steal valuable cargo, redirect communications and, on occasion, even hijack ships. They may be capable of much more.

The [[Mechanical Spider|Mechanical Spiders]] found on [[Petrichor V]] were likely on board the [[UES Contact Light]] before ending up on the planet after the crash.

They seem to be operating outside their usual parameters now that they are on the loose, and [[The Survivor]] questions how long they will be able to operate without an electrical grid.

## Unsolved:
Perhaps the newfound behavior can be connected to the [[Solus Family]] and the soul found at the core of [[Petrichor V]]...?
