While walking through overgrown ruins I found myself surrounded by strange rustling that I could not place. Stepping into a massive temple, vines whipped the entryway shut and the ivy began slithering down the walls. These living Brambles spit caustic venom and I'm thankful to only have holes left in my gloves. Their hypnotic sway distills fear in me and I recognize some higher intelligence in their movements. The bark at their base facilitates some kind of locomotions, though I can't identify any apparant muscular system inside that would drive it. After the encounter, the resulting coughs and spasms left me on edge as I scaled the tower and left the echoes behind me.</span>
