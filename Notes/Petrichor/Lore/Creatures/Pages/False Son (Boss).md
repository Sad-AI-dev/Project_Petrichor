<span class="lore">A mockery of a greater being.
 See brother? Left unsupervised your pets toy with tools beyond their understanding. Do you ignore their endless praise? I doubt it. Does it make you feel better about betraying your own?
 PATHETIC.
 ...
 Have you grown so tired of foolishness you wait to see what happens if you loosen the reins?
 ANSWER ME.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The log is a monologue from [[Mithrix]] commenting on the creation of the [[False Son]], questioning [[Providence]] for allowing such a thing to happen.

It is clear that [[Mithrix]] is not aware of [[Providence|Providence's]] passing at the time that [[False Son]] was created.

[[Mithrix]] calls [[False Son]] a `mockery of a greater being`. This shows that [[Mithrix]] refers to his own species as `greater beings`.
The tools used to create [[False Son]] are mentioned to be beyond the understanding of the denizens of [[Petrichor V]].

The [[False Son]] is found at the top of [[Prime Meridian]], at the peak of the [[Path of the Colossus]].

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The spawn dialogue shows [[False Son|False Son's]] state of mind as the battle begins.
`Leave me.` shows an unwillingness to engage. It appears his attention is elsewhere.
`If you insist.` yet again shows an unwillingness, but not out of fear.

`Have you come seeking a god?` This shows that [[False Son]] believes that the survivor(s) that reached the top of [[Prime Meridian]] came looking for a god. Insinuating that [[False Son]] believes themselves to be a god or that the survivor(s) may have a reason for believing a god can be found at the top of [[Prime Meridian]].
Considering that [[Providence]] and [[Mithrix]] are referred to as gods and that the [[Path of the Colossus]] visually resembles [[Providence]], [[Prime Meridian]] being related to a god is not much of a stretch.

`What are you?` [[False Son]] was created after the events of the [[UES Contact Light]]. This means that it is entirely possible [[False Son]] is unaware of those events, and possibly even of the events of the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED].]] It can thus be concluded that [[False Son]] would not recognize any of the survivors.
Note the specific use of *what* instead of "*who* are you?".

The following lines only appear when the [[Heretic]] reached the [[False Son]]:
`Back again, Vulture?` Here, the [[False Son]] identifies the [[Heretic]] as an [[Alloy Vulture]]. The reason [[False Son]] asks if the [[Heretic]] is "back *again*", is due to the involvement of [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] followers in the creation of [[False Son]], corrupting him. These followers are shown to be [[Alloy Vulture|Alloy Vultures]] wearing [[Beads of Fealty]] in the `Seekers of the Storm` trailer.

`Suffer for the sins of your ilk.` This once again shows the involvement of the [[Alloy Vulture|Alloy Vultures]] in the creation of [[False Son]].
Notably, this also shows that the [[Heretic]] was not personally involved.

`Familiar...` This line shows when the player reaches the top of [[Prime Meridian]] while playing as the [[False Son]]. These lines show a hypothetical scenario where [[False Son (Boss)|False Son]] meets another version of [[False Son]]. In this case, the [[False Son]] remains uninterested, but recognizes that the alter version is similar to his own form.

`How...? No. NO.` In this hypothetical [[False Son]] recognizes the alter version. The realization that he is not unique, and that there are more of him out there appears to be crushing, to the point he rejects the development.

---
The dialogue for when the [[False Son]] hurts a survivor gives a couple insides.
`Expel away your weakness.` It is unclear what this line is referring to, but it may be a reference to the fact that the survivors are mortal. The [[Prime Meridian]] hosts references to reincarnation. Perhaps [[False Son]] believes that death is the path to become something greater.

`Have a taste of divinity.` This shows [[False Son]] views themselves to be a god, due to being created in the image of [[Providence]].

---
The dialogue for when [[False Son]] hurts a survivor during the final phase has a notable line:
`BREAK WITH ME` [[False Son]] was corrupted by [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] followers, this has left him unstable. Perhaps [[False Son]] understands that he is breaking, slowly falling apart.

---
[[False Son]] killing a survivor may generate one of the following lines:
`As it should be.` [[False Son]] believes it his right to remain at the top. His creation not a mistake, but his given right.

`Such small wills.` [[False Son]] believes the survivors to hold much smaller convictions. Perhaps he finds his own goal much more lofty.

If the survivor is the [[Heretic]], [[False Son]] may give the following lines:
`I am awake this time, Vulture.` This is a reference to how [[False Son]] was corrupted by [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] followers, who were [[Alloy Vulture|Alloy Vultures]]. Notably, this shows that [[False Son]] wasn't fully present for the event.

`Return to sender`. Presumably, [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] followers were send by [[Mithrix]] from the moon of [[Commencement]]. This line may be a generic line, or [[False Son]] has reason to believe that killing [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] followers will result in them returning to him.

---
During the final phase, if [[False Son]] kills a survivor, one of these lines may appear:
`it is MY RIGHT.` [[False Son]] was created in the image of [[Providence]], the last ruler of [[Petrichor V]], and thus [[False Son]] believes it his right to rule as his successor.

`AS IMMATERIAL AS THE REST.`  [[False Son]] believes the survivors to be weak, and of little meaning once defeated.

If the killed survivor is the [[Heretic]], one of these lines may appear:
`NOT TWICE, VULTURE.` This is another reference to how [[False Son]] was corrupted, and how he won't lose again.

`EXILE.` This may be a reference to how the [[Heretic]] was exiled to the moon of [[Commencement]]. [[Providence]] exiled the [[Heretic]] once, and [[False Son]] will do so again.

---
The following lines may appear if the [[False Son]] sees the survivor hold the [[Halcyon Seed]]:
`RETURN YOUR STOLEN POWER, VERMIN.` This is in reference how the survivor must have stolen the [[Halcyon Seed]] from the [[Gilded Coast]].
[[False Son]] believes is does not belong to the survivor, and demands it be returned to him, as he inherited part of [[Aurelionite|Aurelionite's]] power.

`You would use her? Against ME?` This comments on the functionality of the [[Halcyon Seed]]: it summons [[Aurelionite]] to fight alongside the survivor. This would result in effectively [[False Son|False Son's]] mother figure being turned against him. It also means that [[Aurelionite|Aurelionite's]] message likely found the [[False Son]], as he does recognize her.

If the survivor is the [[Heretic]], this line may appear:
`WHAT HAVE YOU DONE` This represents the nightmare scenario that [[False Son]] just encountered. Not only has [[Aurelionite]] been defeated, she was defeated by the [[Heretic]] and now the [[Heretic]] is here, having brought along the [[Halcyon Seed]] so that [[Aurelionite]] may be turned against him.
What adds to this is that, arguably, [[Aurelionite]] is one of the few true allies the [[False Son]] has.

If the [[Aurelionite]] dies during the fight, [[False Son]] may respond with one of these lines:
`This gilded thing is... part of me.` This directly proves that [[False Son]] inherited some part of [[Aurelionite]], specifically, his raw form was made of gold, allowing [[Aurelionite]] to pass on some part of her.
It is curious that [[False Son]] refers to [[Aurelionite]] as `This gilded thing`. Perhaps he holds no emotional connection to [[Aurelionite]], merely recognizing the connection. At this point it matters not, [[Aurelionite]] has already fallen.

`Rest. Soon we will all be free.` This line gives some insight into [[False Son|False Son's]] goals. He considers the deceased [[Aurelionite]] to be "free". This begs the question "free from what?".
[[Mithrix]] comes to mind, although the [[False Son]] log entry suggests it to be creating an entirely new path. One free from preconception, for those who don't fit.

[[False Son]] has a variety of lines for when he is defeated, these are some of the notable ones:
`A... GIFT... JUST OUT OF REACH...` [[False Son]] believes he was close to a "gift", but it remained just barely of out reach. This could be in reference to reincarnation, as this mechanic can be found after defeating the [[False Son]]. Alternatively, this could be in reference to the very same "gift" that was given by [[She|Her]] to [[Providence]] (and possibly also [[Mithrix]]).

`I... FEEL MYSELF... Breaking... again...` This is in reference to [[False Son|False Son's]] corruption.

`HE IS LAUGHING... STOP LAUGHING AT ME...` This is in reference to [[Mithrix]]. It is unclear if [[False Son]] can actually hear [[Mithrix]], or if he is merely voicing what he believes [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] reaction to be.
This could suggest that [[Mithrix]] can see the events at [[Prime Meridian]] play out..

`Shackles... locked in golden shackles...` This is in reference to [[Aurelionite]]. Possibly to how [[False Son]] never truly got to escape the shadow of those he was created from. He gained great power, but was never truly free. Like a bird in a golden cage.

---
[[False Son]] can be unlocked as a playable survivor by `Purifying` him using the [[Halcyon Seed]]. Doing so results in the following line:
`THE VOICES... I can hear... me?` It appears that [[False Son|False Son's]] body reacts heavily to being purified by the [[Halcyon Seed]], as voices wash over him. The [[Halcyon Seed]] seems to counteract his corruption. The line ends with [[False Son]] reaching clarity, finally only hearing himself, free from the influence of those who created him.
