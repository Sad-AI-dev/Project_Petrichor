I could not believe my eyes as this creature erupted from the lava. My suit's temperature gauges screeched in warning. How can anything subsist in such heat? The lava parts in waves as the monster swims rapidly through it.

Through craters in the Cremator's thick back armor red hot boulders explode in every direction. The amount of heat and pressure within its body must be a source of immense power. However, its head does not appear as well protected. I pray that it is a source of weakness, for if this leviathan bests me I know there will be no remains left to mark my short existence.</span>

[[The Survivor]] fought a [[Cremator]] in the [[Magma Barracks]]. The area directly surrounding he [[Cremator]] immediately raises in temperature, hitting the limit of what [[The Survivor|The Survivor's]] suit can withstand.

The [[Cremator]] launches exploding projectiles from it's back and [[The Survivor]] believes it's head may be a weak point, due to the notable lack of shielding around it.

[[Cremator|Cremators]] are known to swim through lava.
