Such aggravating creatures! These insects come in droves- as a group their wings create a maddening whine. Even the other creatures seems disturbed by their presence. Though they are not particularly strong, the circling insects certainly frustrate me.

A small amount of their projectile spit managed to penetrate one of the layers of my suit. It was extremely caustic. A festering rash has formed in the area, but doesn't seem to be spreading.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The projectiles spit by the [[Archer Bug]] is incredibly acidic, enough to penetrate through the armor [[The Survivor]] was wearing. The resulting wound created a rash, but didn't spread.

The main environment the [[Archer Bug]] is encountered in is the [[Temple of the Elders]], suggesting that this is possible the region the creature hails from.
