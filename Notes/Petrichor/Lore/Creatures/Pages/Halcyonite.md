This log is a translated message received on `08/03/2057`.
The original format of the message is listed as `Universal Morse Hyper-Acoustic`.
The message was send by [[Aurelionite]] from within the [[Gilded Coast]].

In the message, [[Aurelionite]] mentions that she can no longer feel the presence of her creators and captors: [[Providence]] and [[Mithrix]]. This likely places this message after [[Providence]] is killed by the survivors of the [[UES Contact Light]].
[[Aurelionite]] being unable to feel [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] presence can be explained by [[Mithrix]] having been banished to the moon of [[Commencement]].

The log mentions that [[Aurelionite]] has gone through great effort to try and gather followers on [[Petrichor V]], and that she believes her efforts to have culminated in the creation of [[False Son]].
She views [[False Son]] as her child and wishes they may experience the freedom that she cannot.

[[Aurelionite|Aurelionite's]] stance on [[Providence]] and [[Mithrix]] is elaborated on, as she both mourns and celebrates their loss.

It is made apparent that [[Aurelionite]] wishes to be an ally to [[False Son]], but that [[False Son]] may not be aware of this.

It is likely that the [[Halcyonite]] are followers of [[Aurelionite]].
