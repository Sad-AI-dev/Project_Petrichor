This is the logbook entry of D. Furthen, naturalist for the UES [Redacted] in conjunction with the UES Research and Documentation of Outer Life. I am joined by my good friend Tharson, who is keeping me safe through this journey.

---------------------

On a routine food gathering trek we happened upon a vast fungal grove with towering fungi. Thinking we would take some samples back to test if they were edible, we noticed some of the smaller variety sprout up from the ground and circle around us.

I will describe its properties below. I have assigned their common name as ‘Mini Mushrum’.

• ‘Mini’ is a relative term here, as these mobile mushrooms were larger than Tharson. The subtle glow on the underside of their cap is probably to scare away predators, advertising that they are dangerous to eat.

• Waddling around on short, stubby legs makes them seem quite unsuited for walking. They comically bump into things as they fret about. Perhaps their eyeseight is poor from living in the dark?

• After a long time studying their movements, I suggested to Tharson to retrieve a sample from one to take back with us. The one that the sample was taken from began to flee as the others began shaking, spilling their spores into the air. Our air filtration warnings went off so we left before the cloud of fungal gas became too overwhelming. We did not eat the sample.</span>

This log is an entry from the logbook created by [[D. Furthen & Tharson]], who were aboard the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED].]]

The common name of the [[Mushrum]] is `Mini Mushrum`.
The `Mini` part was added by [[D. Furthen & Tharson]] to point out how relatively small they are compared to the massive mushrooms found in their habitat.
The [[Mushrum]] encountered by [[D. Furthen & Tharson]] were bigger than [[D. Furthen & Tharson|Tharson]].

Much like the [[Hermit Crab]], the [[Mushrum]] appears to be blind and can often be seen bumping into obstacles. This is possibly due to the [[Mushrum]] living in dark habitats.

When harmed, the [[Mushrum]] spreads a particularly toxic cloud of spores, alerting nearby [[Mushrum|Mushrums]] of the danger and fleeing to safety.
The [[Mushrum]] is likely not edible.

I have arrived in an even stranger land. After recovering from my sudden.. teleportation, I noticed that my suit was flashing warnings about air filtration. All across the landscape were giant fungi, some as tall as trees.

When approaching a large bulbous mushroom, it suddenly sprouted out the ground, jumping a few feet in the air then landing on two nubby feet. At this point my air filtration warning went from yellow to red, and I began to have difficulties breathing..

While sentient, these mushrums were not very intelligent. It had what looked like three eyes, but it could not navigate very well, implying that those may be fake eyes to scare predators. It also had no mouth to eat, but would plant itself over corpses, slowly absorbing nutrients through its root-like feet..</span>

This log shows that, after using a [[Teleporter]] for the first time, [[The Survivor]] found himself in the [[Damp Caverns]]. This is the natural habitat of the [[Mushrum]]: deep underground, dark and surrounded by a wide variety of giant mushrooms.

The spores spread by the [[Mushrum]] are dense enough to penetrate through the air filtration of [[The Survivor]], causing them to have trouble breathing.

The [[Mushrum|Mushrum's]] eyes are possibly there just to deter predators. The [[Mushrum]] has no mouth, but has been seen planting itself over corpses, slowly absorbing their nutrients through its small nubby feet.

---
An enemy called the `Giant Mushrum` was cut from development for *Risk of Rain 1*. 
This explains why the [[Mushrum]] are occasionally referred to as `Mini Mushrum`.
