As the title suggests, the [[Gilded Wurms]] are [[Providence|Providence's]] left and right hands, his most loyal servants who can always be found at his side.

The [[Gilded Wurms]] belonging to [[Providence]] die during the events of the [[UES Contact Light]], presumably during the battle at the [[Risk of Rain (location)|UES Contact Light wreckage]]. 
Their corpses can be seen in the [[Helminth Hatchery]].

It is unclear if there are more members of the [[Gilded Wurms|Wurm]] family, but they are explicitly a separate species from the [[Worm Family]]. (Note the difference in spelling).
