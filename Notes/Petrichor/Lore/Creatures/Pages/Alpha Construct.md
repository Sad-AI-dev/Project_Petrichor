This conversation shows the relation between the [[Alpha Construct]] and [[Xi Construct]]. Each [[Xi Construct]] surveys a large area, making use of a large network of [[Alpha Construct|Alpha Constructs]]. Each [[Alpha Construct]] scans the nearby surroundings for hostile entities.

The actual relationship between the constructs in the log shows how the [[Xi Construct]] utilizes humiliation tactics to keep the [[Alpha Construct|Alpha Constructs]] in line. The log ends with the [[Alpha Construct]] overriding the [[Xi Construct]] breaking off the connection.
This behavior shows the remarkable depth in personality that the members of the [[Construct Family]] possess.
