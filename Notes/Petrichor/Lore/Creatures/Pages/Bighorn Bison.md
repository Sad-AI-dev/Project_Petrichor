<span class="lore">“The Saturnian Bison – commonly referred to as the Bighorn Bison of Rademia – is a mystery among zoologists due to their sudden and mysterious disappearance from their native habitat. 

While poaching is considered the current and most likely explanation, strict hunting laws on Saturn debunk this theory. The Bighorn Bison’s incredible strength and insulating coat made it a key predator among the Rademian ecosystem – and their strange, metallic growths made it a popular trophy for hunters. 

To this day, the vanishing of the Saturnian Bison remains as one of zoology’s greatest mysteries.”

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is a passage from a document called [[Xenobiology of the Remus System]].

The full name of the [[Bighorn Bison]] is the `Saturnian Bison`, which is more commonly referred to as the `Bighorn Bison of Rademia`.
This suggests that the [[Bighorn Bison|Bighorn Bison's]] natural habitat is on [[Saturn]]. 

The [[Bighorn Bison]] was also a key part of the `Rademian ecosystem`, suggesting that, possibly through human interference, the [[Bighorn Bison]] appeared in the [[Remus System]].
The title of the document the log is from, specifically the term `Xenobiology` gives credit to this idea.

The [[Bighorn Bison]] mysteriously disappeared from [[Saturn]]. While the creature was popular with poachers, but [[Saturn]] has strict hunting laws, making it unlikely that they were driven to extinction by poachers.

Their appearance on [[Petrichor V]] shows that it's likely that [[Providence]] was responsible for the mysterious disappearance. This shows that [[Providence]] has the ability to reach other planets and bring creatures from these distant plants to the surface of [[Petrichor V]].

The teleporter nearly launched me into a steaming dung heap. I could not have anticipated such an enormous beast being the source. More impressive than their rumbling bellows is the bighorn's charge. Their many tons of muscle produce a crushing slam of horn and matted hair.

When they are not stampeding after me I have observed these monsters using their massive heads to bludgeon rocks and fights amongst themselves. How can they expend so much energy on fruitless activity? Are they merely trying to keep from freezing?</span>

[[The Survivor]] of the [[UES Contact Light]] encountered a [[Bighorn Bison]] directly after making use of a [[Teleporter]]. 
The destination of this [[Teleporter]] was very likely [[Ancient Valley]]. 
This is because [[The Survivor]] guesses that the strange behavior of the [[Bighorn Bison|Bighorn Bisons]] was related to the cold temperatures, and [[Ancient Valley]] is the only cold environment the [[Bighorn Bison]] can be found in during gameplay in Risk of Rain Returns.
