<span class="lore">“Many scholars have written of a lifeforce present in the ground we walk on. That the earth under our feet is alive, in its own way. After my experiences on this planet, I can contribute to that theory; Petrichor V is home to Golems, each towering over humans at roughly 10 feet high, and comprised of stone and twine and animated by mysterious, otherworldly forces. 

From basic observation, the Golems seem to act as a defense garrison for Petrichor. While gentle with inhabitants of the planet, their true power emerges when they enter the battlefield. Manipulating a potent energy source, the Golems attack with powerful shockwaves and laser beams capable of blasting away cliff faces with ease. At the time of writing, the mechanisms that animate the Golems are still unknown.”

This log is a short fragment from a first draft for [[The Mysteries of Petrichor V]].

The [[Stone Golem|Stone Golems]] can be found all over [[Petrichor V]] and seem to be animated by an otherworldly force. It is likely these were created by [[Providence]] and [[Mithrix]] to serve as protectors.
Notably, the [[Stone Golem|Stone Golems]] act gently towards the other inhabitants of [[Petrichor V]].

Each [[Stone Golem]] are capable of manipulating a potent energy source. This allows them to attack using powerful laser beams.

As established in the [[Lens-Maker's Glasses]], the [[Stone Golem]] can be defeated by hurting it in their glowing red eye.
