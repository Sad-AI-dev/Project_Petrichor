Could this be..? Tales I never believed recounted a horrible beast, fire incarnate. Scourge of another solar system, the Ifrit nearly wiped out an entire space colony before being chained and launched into the great black void. Supposedly the flaming jets that accompanied his roars could be seen for days as he drifted outwards.

Great towers, what must have been the containment structure used to trap this monster, prevent his escape even on this forsaken plane. The only explanation I have for my surviving this legendary encounter is his many years drifting in space and having been fettered in this unforgiving, frozen wasteland.</span>

[[The Survivor]] encountered the [[Ifrit]] in the [[Ancient Valley]].
[[Ifrit]] is the subject of well known folklore throughout the galaxy. A terrible natural disaster hailing from a distant solar system, the incarnation of fire.

[[Ifrit]] was supposedly defeated by being chained and launched into deep space after wiping out an entire space colony.

[[The Survivor]] believes that the towers that are summoned by [[Ifrit]] are possibly the very containment structure that was used to trap the creature.
[[Ifrit]] was likely weakened by the long time it spend traveling through space and the time is spend in the cold of the [[Ancient Valley]].
