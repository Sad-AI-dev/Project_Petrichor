# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The members of the [[Construct Family]] can be found in select networks all over [[Petrichor V]]. These networks consist of at least one [[Xi Construct]] and a large number of [[Alpha Construct|Alpha Constructs]].

The event warning indicates that the members of the [[Construct Family]] have been around for an incredibly long time.
Visually, the members appear to be primarily made of a material resembling stone, with a bright yellow core. It is possible these were created by [[Providence]] and / or [[Mithrix]]. The methods used in their constructions may be similar to those used in the construction of the [[Artifact Key]].
