<span class="lore">"Recycling is an important thing. And I don't mean recycling a glass bottle to help the environment - though that's important too! No, by 'recycling,' I mean taking one thing, and using it for another. For example, my Ukelele. I love this thing. It has electric properties, and passes them on to my attacks - free chain lightning! But what if I were to 'recycle' it? I think the Uke would make a pretty good melee weapon. Imagine, bludgeoning a Lemurian and pumping it full of volts, in one easy step.

Do you get what I'm saying? There's opportunities for recycling all over the place. You just need to open your mind to the possibilities, and see... And do a little recycling. It's good for the environment."

- Lost Journal, recovered from Petrichor V</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Lysate Cell]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[Fuel Cell]].

The log is a fragment from a [[Lost Journal]], which was recovered from [[Petrichor V]].

This log gives additional insight into the survivor that wrote the log, mentioning that he was in possession of a [[Ukulele]], and how they imagine being able to use it as a melee weapon if needed against a [[Lemurian]].

The underlying message is that keeping an open mind is crucial to surviving on [[Petrichor V]].
It is unclear if the survivor came from the [[UES Contact Light]] or the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED],]] although the rudimentary nature of the information shared suggests that they came from the [[UES Contact Light]].

Additionally, the survivor still seems to be fairly sane at the time this log was written, suggesting this was written early on in their time survivor on [[Petrichor V]].

A `Lysate` is a substance that disintegrates cell walls / membranes. This is ironic considering the item is also a cell.
