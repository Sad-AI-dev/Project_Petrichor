The [[Polylute]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[Ukulele]].

This log was generated by the [[DataScraper (v3.1.53 - beta branch)]] program.

The log seems to be a transmission, though it seems to suffer from interference.
The cleaned up log is likely:

<span class="lore">I've made a fascinating discovery! Deep in this strange [world?], I found some carvings on the cliffside. It appears to be... music! There's nothing else it could be! I'll attempt to transcribe it, though the interference may muddy up transmissions. Ahem...

d, d, d, a, G. Are you getting this? There's more.

Assuming this cleanup is accurate, it is very possible that this is a transmission from a survivor on [[Petrichor V]], being send to another location on the planet, for example one of the Rallypoints, such as [[Rallypoint Delta]].

The only other time music is encountered on [[Petrichor V]], is in the culture of the [[Lemurian Family]], which prominently features song and dance.
Thus the music being transcribed is possibly written in [[Lemurian Script]].

It is unclear what the last line once contained, nor is it clear what song is being transcribed.
