"I have this key. I found it one day when I was taking a walk along the beach... It was washed up on the shore, all covered in crust and sand. I dunno why, but I took it with me... I figured it would be neat to try and figure out what this key went to. It'd be like a treasure hunt, y'know? Thing is, no matter who I went to, I never found anything. Any lock that seemed to match, the key wouldn't go in all the way. I was starting to get frustrated. I... I'm not too religious, but for some reason, I felt it was my destiny to use this old, beat-up key and find its match. M-Maybe it would change my life. I dunno. And, when I heard about this mission, for some reason, my heart began to race. I've heard all about the Contact Light's disappearance, everyone has. But... I don't know why, but I felt, in my heart of hearts... Whatever this key went to was where the Contact Light was. And it was my destiny to come along."</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Encrusted Key]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[Rusted Key]].

This log is an audio recording from aboard the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED].]]

The survivor found the [[Encrusted Key]] washed up on the shore. This suggests that the influence of [[The Void]] spreads far beyond [[Petrichor V]].

Additionally, the survivor is aware of the [[UES Contact Light]], it's unfortunate fate, and that the mission of the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED] ]]is related to the disappearance of the [[UES Contact Light]]. The specific phrasing of `disappearance` suggests that the survivor may not be aware of [[Petrichor V]].
