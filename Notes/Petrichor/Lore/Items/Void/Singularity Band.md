# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Singularity Band]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[Runald's Band]] and the [[Kjaro's Band]].

The log is the `Apocryphal Verse` from [[The Syzygy of Io and Europa]].

This seems to be a much more dark interpretation of the vows seen in the [[Runald's Band]] and [[Kjaro's Band]] logs.

Much like the items, the `Apocryphal Verse` ends with 2 entities ending as 1.
