We take kindling and throw it in the fire.

The fire is pleased. The fire grows.

We take fruit and throw it in the fire.

The fire loves this gift. Embers pop from the fire and perform dances of joy before fading. Compounds inside the fruit are undone, returning to their base components. There are so many colors. So much energy.

We take a body and throw it into the fire. It will not be missed. He has more to spare.

The fire loves this gift. Fat in the body burns, producing a rainbow of beautiful hues in the flame. Muscles contract and snap, stimulated by the gnawing heat. The fire claims its meal, and returns it to energy.

So much energy. I believe I can work with this.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Voidsent Flame]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[Will-o'-the-wisp]].

This log was translated by the [[MyBabel Machine Translator]] program.

The log is a series of observations regarding a small fire. The observer throws various objects into the fire, all of which burn.

Notably, a body is thrown into the fire. The observer comments `It will not be missed. He has more to spare.`

The log concludes that the observer can work with this.

I believe this log may be a record from the perspective of [[Mithrix]] discovering the prime material of fire. The body is a random inhabitant of [[Petrichor V]], and the `He` mentioned would be [[Providence]].
Admittedly, it seems a bit out of character for [[Providence]] not to care about the death of one of his denizens, but perhaps this is simply [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] perspective, who can't imagine caring about a random body.
