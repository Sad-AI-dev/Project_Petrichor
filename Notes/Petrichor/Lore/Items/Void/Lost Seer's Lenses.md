<span class="lore">"What does it mean to see?

To a beast, it means to identify potential food and mates. To propagate, to survive. Sight is nothing more than a means to an end, is it not?

To someone like me... To those who know true purpose... To see is to LIVE. To see is to spot that one little crack in the enemy's armor, to spot that smallest moment of hesitation when they rear back to strike.

To see the way flesh folds once the skull gives in to your weapon.

Yes, it's the little things, but seeing those things... REALLY seeing them. Ah, it fulfills you. I do hope you understand... And if not, you will eventually, if you've read this note."

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Lost Seer's Lenses]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[Lens-Maker's Glasses]].

This log is a fragment of a [[Lost Journal]], which was recovered from [[Petrichor V]]. This means that the author of the [[Lost Journal]] is a survivor of either the [[UES Contact Light]] or the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED].]]

Most of the entry speaks on how essential *sight* is to one's chances of survival on [[Petrichor V]].

It appears that the survivor is either losing their sanity or starting to develop somewhat of an extended sense for sight when it comes to combat.
