Shipping Details:

Hey, me in the past. This'll sound really corny, but I've been really into gardening lately. Now, before you say anything, you gotta think about the situation I'm in. I mean, with all the stuff going on, anyone would go nuts if they had to deal with - oops. No spoilers, my bad.

Anyway, remember that chronobauble? The one we found on Mercury? Turns out, it has a "fast-forward" feature. I, um, tried to use it to help some hybrids I was growing mature faster. Botany stuff, you'll get it later - well, I may have made it go a bit too fast. This thing must've gone through a few millennia by the time I turned the dial back to 0. I'm pretty sure this is like, an entirely new genus of plant? Maybe even an entirely separate species. Note to self: remember to never turn the dial up to 11. You WILL create an abomination of evolution.

Anyways, same drill as last time - shipping this to myself in 10 years. 10 years passes quickly, especially if it's contained within a locally accelerated temporal field. Yeah, it'll go by in the blink of an eye - alongside a couple millenia! Maybe I should take up scrapbooking next.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Tentabauble]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[Chronobauble]].

This item is being shipped to [[Mercury]]. The shipping details are identical to the [[Chronobauble]], except exactly 10 years later.

The log was likely produced by [[The Void]] in the [[Simulacrum]]. This is due to the log being a continuation of the [[Chronobauble]] log, though it takes place 10 years in the future. But for the contents of the message to occur, the [[Chronobauble]] would have to arrive at it's destination, but we know it was aboard either the [[UES Contact Light]] or [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED],]] and ended up on the surface of [[Petrichor V]].
