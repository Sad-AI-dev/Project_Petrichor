Subject: Newly Hatched Zoea
Technician: X. Shun
Table Spec: BioSaf, spectroscopic hood enabled
Notes:

- Taking a moment to contain myself.
- It's been quite a while since we've received a sample--INTACT sample--so I am being abundantly cautious.
- Sample is in excellent condition.  I am pleased with the care Jiminez took compared to her predecessor.
- Sample appears to be an undocumented carcinized species.  Perhaps a juvenile?
- Attempting to biopsy epidermis
- Exterior of the sample is too hard for my scalpel
- I believe I have found the oral cavity.  Attemping oral biopsy.

The [[Newly Hatched Zoea]] can be retrieved from a [[Void Devastator]].

The [[Newly Hatched Zoea]] is the void-corrupted version of all boss-tier items, with the exception of [[Artifact Key|Artifact Keys]]![[Artifact_Key.webp|24]], [[Encrypted Cerebellum|Encrypted Cerebellums]]![[Encrypted_Cerebellum.webp|24]], [[Exposed Cerebellum|Exposed Cerebellums]]![[Exposed_Cerebellum.png|24]], [[Prison Matrix|Prison Matrices]]![[Prison_Matrix.webp|24]], and [[Sentry Key|Sentry Keys]]![[Sentry_Key.webp|24]].

This log is the analysis file for a lab dissection of the [[Newly Hatched Zoea]], performed by [[X. Shun]].
The specimen was procured by a survivor called [[Jiminez]], who did substantially better then `her` predecessor.

The technician attempts an biopsy of the outer layer of the skin, which is too hard to pierce with a scalpel.

Something goes very wrong when attempting to cut something through the oral cavity.
This ends rather poorly for [[X. Shun]]

It is possible that the fact the technician has not received an intact specimen in a while is a reference to the [[Defense Nucleus]], which would pin [[X. Shun]] as the protagonist for that log as well.
