<span class="lore">"Luck? Who needs luck, in a place like this.

To survive here, you'd need more than just luck. You need intuition. Instinct. The right tools. Power.

I know you're scared. And I am too. But if there's anything this hell hole has taught me...

We make our own luck."

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Benthic Bloom]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[57 Leaf Clover]].

The log is a [[Signal Echo]] from the [[UES Contact Light]].

The log seems to be a fragment of a conversation between two survivors from the [[UES Contact Light]]. One seems to be deeply frightened by their scenario, while the other talks about not needing luck, but making their own.

`Benthic` refers to the deepest part of a body of water, this could point to the origin of the [[Benthic Bloom]] being somewhere deep within [[The Void]].
