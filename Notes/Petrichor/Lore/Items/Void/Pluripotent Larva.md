# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">"Life finds a way. Even in the depths of creation, there's bound to be something crawling along the sand, just hoping to make it through the day.

Why don't you take a ride in their shoes, just for one day? You may come out of the experience with a brand new perspective."</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Pluripotent Larva]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[Dio's Best Friend]].

It is unclear who is speaking in this quote, nor who they are addressing or where it was spoken, but it seems to be offering some individual the novel experience of surviving as a small creature along the sand, finding a way through life.

This suggests that this is being offered by [[The Void]], as only the [[Simulacrum]] would be capable of simulation something like this.

The term `Pluripotent` refers to a cell that can give rise to a variety of different cells.

When revived through this item the usual `Revived!` message is replaced with `Revived..?`
The eye of the [[Pluripotent Larva]] constantly moves, but is completely dimmed once consumed.
