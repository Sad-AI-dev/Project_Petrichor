# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Safer Spaces]] is the void-corrupted version of the [[Tougher Times]].

The log is a reference to `Insufferable issue #6`.

Visually, the [[Safer Spaces]] resembles a Tardigrade, which is also known as `Water Bear`, which are microscopic creatures known for their survivability.

The name `Safer Spaces` is the literal opposite of `Tougher Times`. `Tough -> Safe | Time -> Space`. Additionally, both names are alliterations.
