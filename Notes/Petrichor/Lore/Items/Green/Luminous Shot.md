The 2057 NextTech winner is the Luminous Shot, crafted by Inventor M. Louis VI of Europa.

M. Louis comments on her victory, ’Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to progress. Looking forward to next year.’

Coming in 2nd, the Preon Accumulator, crafted by Technician Neil Hasting of Earth. Neil comments, ’I’m proud of what I submitted, but these fancy Europans put up a good fight, using [REDACTED] tech? How did she even find that? Her cross-weapon sync theory demands respect. See you next year for a rematch, Maggie.’
The coup still fresh on Europa’s mind, the new acting government confronts her controversial work on the Crowdfunder, a tool of suppression used by the old monarchy. M. Louis replies to critics, ’I take responsibility for the abuse of my invention, I ask that you evaluate my work going forward by how it can help us prevent this kind of tragedy.’"
