Two UES Cadets cluster behind their scanning machine to stare at a small, simple-looking star.

"What IS it though? I thought it threw an alert?"

"Well it’s not anymore, maybe the scanner is finally goin’." One Cadet flips the star around and squints. "I think there’s a B carved into it…"

"Wish it would, they won’t send us a new one until this fossilizes." The other Cadet slaps the scanner.

A visiting General turns the corner and cuts in, "Problem, Cadets?"

Both Cadets squeal and snap to attention, saluting the General. The suspicious star clatters down the approval chute with a loud affirming buzz.

The General turns to hide a grin as he leaves, "As you were."

The Cadets exchange a nervous glance over the chute. Probably nothing.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The log is a small fragment between 2 UES Cadets in charge of scanning and sorting items to be shipped by the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED].]]
The scanner shows how UES is stingy when it comes to replacing faulty equipment.

There is a B carved into the sale star, it is unclear what the meaning of this is, but it likely threw an alert in the UES security system.

The log likely takes place before the ship left towards [[Petrichor V]].
The use of military positions such as `Cadet` and `General` suggests that UES has a similar structure to that of a military, or the commercial marine industry.
