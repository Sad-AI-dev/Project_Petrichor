Shipping Details:

Everyone said that I was crazy to search for lost artifacts on Mars. Idiots. There hasn’t been any proof of a previous civilization - but I’ve always trusted my gut. This skull proves that I’m right - that something did exist here before.

That smug professor at the university... always disparaging my research. I loved seeing the look on his face as I shook his hand. Idiot. Karma must have been working overtime - I heard he fell ill shortly after. I suppose my success was just too much for him.

...In fact, everyone I’ve shown seems to not be returning my calls. Are they avoiding me? Are they scared this news would shake up their academic communities? Too proud to admit I’m right?

I’ll find someone who will give me the recognition I deserve. I’ve worked too hard and done too much. If I don’t keep going, I think I might just die.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].
The item was discovered on [[Mars]], but no knowledge of a previous civilization on [[Mars]] exists. This suggests that the item may have been placed here.

The last holder of the Death Mark noticed that individuals they interact with fall ill. It is hinted towards that the item has a downside for wielding it, but it is unclear what this downside is.

It is possible that the Death Mark is magical in nature.
