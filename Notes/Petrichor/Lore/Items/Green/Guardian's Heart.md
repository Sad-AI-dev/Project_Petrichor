Test subject 150053 results. While living, the subject had advanced muscle growth, cell regeneration, higher agility, and increased intelligence, along with a blue hue to his skin.  
On 08/23/2056, the subject broke free of his restraints and freed all other test subjects. All test subjects, including 150053, were terminated.  
  
His heart seems to still beat independent of the rest of his body. Perhaps a transplant into another subject can continue research.
