I got your back!!! This brand is, in my opinion, THE BEST against those pesky crawlers over there. Trust me, I tried plenty. People always say they need to be protected because blahblah 'they are endangered!!!' but I AM SO GLAD THEY ARE. It's SO ANNOYING to have to deal with their disgusting chirring at night. Every. Single. Day. Take care and STAY GOLDEN!!
