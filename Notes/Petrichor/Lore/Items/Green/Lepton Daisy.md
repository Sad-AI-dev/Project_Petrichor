Dear Stalnia,

I haven't been able to visit for a while, so I hope you and Libra are doing well. I heard that you're clearing the land there and want to spruce things up. I'm sending this flower I picked in the Carbon Fields of Electron Valley. The terraformers there told me that, over time, landscaping efforts were improved by the organic-band signals sent out by this plant. I've been helping them build a new world.

Just make sure to put it up high enough that Mushka can't get to it. I'm not sure what effect it'll have on dogs...</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Earth]] to an individual called Stalnia.

The log shows how the Lepton Daisy has a positive effect on nearby landscaping efforts.

The location [[Electron Valley]] and the Carbon Fields within are mentioned by name, although it is unclear where or what these locations represent. The name resembles Silicon Valley, suggesting that [[Electron Valley]] may in some ways be a continuation of Silicon Valley.
