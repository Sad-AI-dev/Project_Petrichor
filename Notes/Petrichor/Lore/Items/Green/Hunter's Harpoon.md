They say that you can spear two catches with one throw of this ol' lassie. And hey, if you can't, if you're fast enough, nobody will be able to tell the difference! Wahahaha!</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
It is unclear what planet this item is being shipped too. It should be noted that `Kellhaul Key` is likely a reference to a location in *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door*.

The items appears entirely mundane, but there may be more than meets the eye.
