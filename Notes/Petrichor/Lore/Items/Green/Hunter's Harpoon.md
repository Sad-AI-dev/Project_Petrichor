They say that you can spear two catches with one throw of this ol' lassie. And hey, if you can't, if you're fast enough, nobody will be able to tell the difference! Wahahaha!</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
It is unclear what planet this item is being shipped too. It should be noted that `Keelhaul Key` is likely a reference to a location in *Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door*.

The items appears entirely mundane, but there may be more than meets the eye.

Keep this somewhere safe. The old hunters got run out a long time ago by the fishing regulations so this is a real relic. I put a new rope on it myself, but I wouldn't recommend it using it. Maybe you can find a museum that'll take it? Back in the day the shape was supposed to mean something maybe someone out there knows some Martian history? I can't sell it, so I figure I may as well give it to someone who might appreciate it. It's priority so hopefully this thing doesn't get lost.
