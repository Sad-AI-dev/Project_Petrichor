You didn't tell me the roe was FERTILIZED. Good Lord! Anyways, one of the suckers actually hatched, and have been nothing but friendly to me. Filial imprinting, perhaps.  
I quite like the little guy. He is almost dog-like in how affectionate he is to me. I.. have begun to care a lot about the thing. I've been feeding nutapples and he seems to enjoy it, but I doubt that it's very nutritious. Suggestions?
