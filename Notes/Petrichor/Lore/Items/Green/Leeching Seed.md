<span class="lore">It was a crisp evening - and things were looking up. The botanist began walking towards the Plant Biology Complex to check on several alien plants that had been recovered from the week before.

Another worker was already in the complex, busy at work.

“Hey.” “Oh, hello!” The worker greeted her enthusiastically. He was carrying several bags of fertilizer, and she gave him a quizzical look. “You need any help with those?” She said, gathering her clipboard for her check.

“Oh no, I’m alright. It’s a good workout, actually,” he said. As they walked, the botanist couldn’t help but wonder what kind of job would require THAT much fertilizer.

As the door to the greenhouse whirred open, she got her answer – roots scaling the height of the greenhouse and snaking along the ceiling, even invading the containers of other specimens. “What the hell!?” She cried, her jaw slack. And then she noticed the other plants. 

Every other plant in the greenhouse had withered – with an incriminating root leading back to the overgrowth that the worker was now feeding fertilizer. The botanist was speechless. “What happened...? What... what is that...?” She stammered. The worker turned to her and grinned.

“One of the species we got in the last expedition. He demands a lot of nutrients - it took me so long to get him to even sprout. I was wracking my brain, trying every trick in the book. And every other specimen seemed to be growing fine, so I figured, hey, why not share some of that? And look!”

Spreading his arms, the worker marveled at the gallery of dead plants. Dropping her clipboard, the botanist’s stomach sank. Things were no longer looking up.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log covers two botanists doing research on recently discovered alien plants.

The log reveals some information about the state of exploration of the universe, as many alien plants are still unknown to the point biologists don't know how to grow them.

The main thing the log covers is the nature of the leeching seed. It's an alien plant that struggles to survive on its own, but it capable of draining nutrients from other plant matter, and perhaps other living matter.

Order Details:</span>
These seeds are recently germinating, so be quick! These flesh-infesting pods seem to burrow, balloon, and then pop in a few months. Most test patients have.. died. However, before they die, they feel increased health and state of mind!  
In fact, the pods themselves seem to develop spores, which if collected can be turned into a pain reliever..  
  
Find a way to stop its growth cycle at that state, and you have yourself a great healing agent.

This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].

The [[Leeching Seed]] is a strain of plant that feeds on flesh. When inserted it briefly provides great healing and pain relieving properties, before bursting and killing the patient.

It is likely that these are a different species from the [[Leeching Seed]] seen in Risk of Rain 2.
