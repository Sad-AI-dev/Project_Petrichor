Order details:
Impressed? I know you are.
We finally cleared our grid, but man did it put up a fight. We lost James and Kight. This fin knocked them off the U.E.S.S. [REDACTED] with so much force we heard them hit the water in pieces. At least it was quick.

There isn’t a speck of land on this blasted planet but now it’s safe enough to build our first dock. It’s not land, but it’s a step up from this flotsam. I won’t miss giant sea creatures bumping the ship in the night, or losing my lunch to this damn swaying.

Get us a good commission for it will ya? And send down some playing cards, the silence is killing us.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to the [[Boron System]], in which a port station has been placed by UES.
It appears that there is a planet in the [[Boron System]] that is entirely covered in deep oceans, creating the need for naval units to eliminate threats, allowing for construction.

The item is a small part of a larger marine lifeform.
