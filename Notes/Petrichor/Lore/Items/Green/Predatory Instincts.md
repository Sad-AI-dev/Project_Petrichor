<span class="lore-text">`Critical Strikes` increase attack speed. Stacks 3 times.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">Gossip spreads quickly in terrified communities. Stories that keep the more fearful lizardfolk in their passageways. Hushed tales that frighten the most commanding of stone constructs and woodfolk and creatures of the plains. Fear travels between the trees and the valleys.

A demon, fallen from the Sky, mighty enough to slay Providence and his Wurms. Only two arms, two legs - but with 22 unblinking, crimson eyes.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log resembles a rumor, or a myth spread amongst the denizens of [[Petrichor V]].
The [[Lemurian Family]], [[Golem Family]], in addition to `woodfolk` and `creatures of the plains` are mentioned.

The myth makes mention of the `Demon that fell from the Sky`, who was a survivor from the [[UES Contact Light]] who killed [[Providence]] and his [[Gilded Wurms]]. The 22 unblinking crimson eyes are likely in reference to the [[Lens-Maker's Glasses]] item.
