I do as you say, I bring my friend Pebl, but I do not like it.
Father, must we leave her?

Humling, we must return Pebl to her first family.
To honor our agreement, we return her before your Humling days are behind you.

I do as you say, I think she will like leaning here, do you?
Father, where is her family?
Humling, when the demon fell from the Sky, many families hid themselves away.
To protect her, her family will see the demon resolved before returning.
I do as you say.
Father, I will miss her.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The log covers a conversation between 2 [[Lemurian|Lemurians]] as they deliver the item back to a culturally significant location deep in the `Stone territory`.

The item is referred to as `Pebl` (my beloved). The log shows how young [[Lemurian|Lemurians]] are referred to as [[Humling|Humlings]].

There appears to be an agreement between the [[Lemurian Family]] and the [[Golem Family]] to give small dolls to the [[Humlings]], which are to be returned before they grow up.

The log goes on to mention that when the [[UES Contact Light]] crashed upon the surface of [[Petrichor V]], many inhabitants went into hiding, while the members of the [[Golem Family]] answered the call from [[Providence]] to kill the invaders, so that peace may be restored.

`Pebl` will be missed :(
