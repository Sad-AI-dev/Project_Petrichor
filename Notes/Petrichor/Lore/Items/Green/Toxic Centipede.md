Order Details:</span>
Extremely interesting species found on OMEGA-19. Resembles a worm, snake, or limbless lizard. Seems to exude poison from its glands, so much that the 'worm' can even contain it in its mouth.  
  
May be a strain of stomach parasites found on other planets, but obviously much larger and deadlier. I hope you find some interesting knowledge from this species; it killed 16 of our workers alone.  
  
It also seem to give offspring everytime, but we have found only 13. Please respond quickly.
