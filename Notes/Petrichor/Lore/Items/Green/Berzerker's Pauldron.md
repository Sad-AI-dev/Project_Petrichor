Another antique for the collection. This bad boy was found on the battlefield where much of the War was fought. The excavation site was littered with bones, all surrounding the remains of one rebel soldier, who was carrying this artifact. According to hearsay and rumors, rebel soldiers wearing pauldrons much like this one would enter trances on the battlefield. Time would slow down, and all they could see was the enemy.

Of course, it’s just speculation, but… There were a lot of bodies surrounding this thing’s old owner. Be careful, OK?</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Earth]]. This is an old artifact used by a rebel soldier in [[The War of 2019]]. Supposedly, the item allows the wearer to `enter a trance, causing time to slow down` and that `all they could see was the enemy`.

The area this is being shipped to is called `Jungle VII`, suggesting that, possible as a result of [[The War of 2019]], earth's territories changed significantly.
