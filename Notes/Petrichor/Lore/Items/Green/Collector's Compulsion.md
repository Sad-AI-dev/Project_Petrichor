<span class="lore">"In the year 2034, the renowned Black Friday sale was permanently banned in all world markets after a gruesome stampede erupted at the New Times Square Shopping Mall. Approximately 35 were killed in the stampede, and dozens more were critically injured. A notable participant in the stampede was 43-year-old Susan Monroe, a single mother who was responsible for taking the lives of 5 innocent shoppers. In an interview, Susan claimed: "I mean, can you blame me? My boy wanted the new gaming console, and it was on sale for 5 dollars. 5 dollars! I'd do it again for that price.""
