Psst. Hey. Yeah, I'm whispering over text.  
  
So the upgrades for your drones are in. It's compatible with all KS-I slotted drones, even the non-combat oriented ones, so you can refurbish some of your cleaning units to help in the fight. Strap it onto the back, and the drone AI should sort itself out. Contains both a missile and mortar launcher. Let's continue this arms race, eh?
