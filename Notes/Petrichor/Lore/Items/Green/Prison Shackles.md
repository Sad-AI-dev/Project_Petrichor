Order Details:</span>
An artifact from the old ages, before we used holo-cuffs. The advantage is that EMP blasts and remote-hacking can't disable good-old steel and chains. Fitting this on larger prisoners may be harder.  
I know you guys have been having a serious break-out problem in the last few months, and this is sure to throw those prison breakers for a loop. Just don't lose the key.  
  
We are shipping about.. 500, because we have nothing better to do with them than smelt them for steel, which is barely worth more than dirt this day and age. Would probably cost more than getting rid of them.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to the same location as the [[Taser]].

The location this is being shipped to is very likely a prison. After traditional hand-cuffs were replaced with holo-cuffs, EMP blasts and remote-hacking become popular methods to break out of them.
`Fort Mason` is struggling with a series of break-outs.
