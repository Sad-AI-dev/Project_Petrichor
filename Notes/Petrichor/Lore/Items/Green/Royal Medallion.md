On the outer orbits of our system lies a confederacy of people. With kings and lords; knights and warriors, it's monarchical in nature, Each member of the major hierarchy carries a medallion, granting courage and fortitude. This one belonged to a prince, his name buried under strife and accusations of treachery. Stripped away from his belongings, his medallion remained as nothing more than a curiosity by the humble forager who found it, far from where it was worn. Now, I pass it on to you. Whether your destiny lies in the stars or your heart calls for home, your valor will be unrivaled. Keep fighting, son.
