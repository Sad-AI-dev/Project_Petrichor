"You don’t want to re-name it Bill-o-the-Wisp?"
"NO."
"JAR-ed?"
"NO."
"Then what about FLARE-ed?"
"STOP."
"It needs a name, it’s no dif-FIRE-ent than you or me."
"Next time we’re at base I’m applying for a transfer."
"You know that won’t go through until at least Dec-EMBER."
"How long have you been waiting to use these?"
"Coming up with them on the spot. I’ve got a good head on my SMOULDERS."
"You can stop emphasizing those words so much. I get it."
"I will never stop FUELING around."

"Want to grab something to eat when we get back?"
"Thank the stars that’s over, yes. I hope they’re not serving that gruel we had yesterday."
"Maybe they’ll cook you a pep-PYRO-ni pizza?"

Order Details:</span>
Found the little thing on my last hike up. Tiny guy; must be a baby. He (she?) doesn't seem to eat anything at all, so I'm hoping you guys can help the fella out. I don't think he can get out of the jar; it hasn't made any attempt to.

This item is being shipped to [[Venus]].

It appears that the [[Will-o'-the-wisp]] is a living creature that seemingly doesn't need anything to sustain itself and is perfectly content staying within the jar.
