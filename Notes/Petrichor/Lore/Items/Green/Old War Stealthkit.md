Shipping Details:

We've managed to round up all the local Old War artifacts that we could find. A lot of interesting things here: rifles, rations, pamphlets. We even found a prototype stealthkit in fantastic condition; that could be a great centerpiece for your exhibit.

However, a slight issue: in transit, the truck hit a pothole and jostled all the ship. It seemed to have actually activated the stealth drive - some strange short-circuit - and our team can't actually confirm the location of the stealthkit. It should be in one of the boxes - we will be expecting the commission to include the stealthkit.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Earth]].

The item was an early prototype, developed during a period known as the [[Old War]]. It is unclear where or when this war took place, but it is likely long ago, considering the materials used to construct the prototype.
This would suggest that the [[Old War]] took place on earth.

The item has a habit of sporadically activating.
