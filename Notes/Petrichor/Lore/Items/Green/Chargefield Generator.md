You know those anti-theft devices you can stick on your car? Yeah, it's like that, but for an individual. How it is used is up to you guys; first thought is military or self-protection.  
  
You need to charge it generally after every use. It can /actually/ be charged off of bio-electrical signals, which sounds strange because of how weak they are, but in times of desperation we've found that effective as well. Up to you.
