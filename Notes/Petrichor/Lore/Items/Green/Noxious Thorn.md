"Campbell, where did Furthen go?" 
"Wanted a ’closer look’ at the native fauna. Took Tharson." 
"…Absolute loon. You done yet?" 
Campbell glares at Andrews, then gasps.
Behind him dozens of dots climb the sky, growing to clay jars at their apex.
Clay shatters against the camp in a brief violent hail, coating it in yellow ichor and chaos. 
[5 minutes later] 
Campbell snaps awake to a scream cut short by a wet slice. She struggles out from under half of Andrews and gags at the vile smell. Shouting, chiton, gunfire, then silence. 
A limping Beetle approaches, it’s stump leg crunches onto thorns hidden by ichor and it shrieks, convulsing. Campbell screams and fires but her pistol jams with ichor. The Beetle shudders and it’s many small wounds open and turn to sickly, yellow rivers.
The Beetle twitches and falls, a splash of its warm blood hits Campbell.</span>
