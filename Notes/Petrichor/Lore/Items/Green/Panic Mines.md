Order Details:</span>
Must be strapped onto vehicles, NOT personnel! After taking heavy fire, the automatic dispenser should drop and are a mine to make a hasty retreat (or blow enemies sky-high who are dumb enough to follow.)  
Includes smart-fire, but leave the blast radius regardless. the laws of phisics dont pick sides. Very high yield for how small it is.  
  
If you want to use it offensively.. then.. well just get shot. A lot. Preferably by small arms fire, or you'll die trying to have the mines drop
