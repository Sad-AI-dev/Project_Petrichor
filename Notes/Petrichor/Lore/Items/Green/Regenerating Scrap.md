"Hey, Joe, how's the work in engineering?"

"Terrible. We have a shipment of this... weird, prototype material. Some kind of metal? They want us to make stuff out of it, which isn't too bad. Thing is, no matter how much I take, there always seems to be more. Did you know I made twenty-five hundred units of .300 caliber rounds from a 10 kilo crate of metal?"

"How much!?"

"Right!? I feel like I'm losing my mind. It's not even half-way empty. Hell, I bet there's more in there than when I started!"

"Well, at least you won't have to worry about running out..."</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is a fragment of a conversation between 2 survivors on the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED].]]
The log shows how there was a functional engineering job site and how the crew made use of organic regenerating materials to print whatever they had a need for.

This explains how the survivors did not run out of ammunition, even though they found themselves stranded on an alien planet trying to kill them.
