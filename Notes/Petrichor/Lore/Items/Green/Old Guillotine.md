Shipping Details:

Everyone is still operating on adrenaline here. We finally overthrew our oppressors and have taken back Primas V! I know some of the overlords will attempt to buy their way onto a stealth transport, but that’s going to be quite difficult due to their epic economic blunder.

We don’t just want blood for all the injustices we’ve suffered at their hands. We want to send a message to would-be sympathizers. This old guillotine will serve both as an execution method and a symbol to strike fear into their hearts wherever they might be hiding.

Primas V is alive!</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Primas V]], and is also being send from [[Primas V]].
[[Primas V]] recently went through a revolution, seeing the economic elite fleeing or facing public execution.

A major economic blunder led to the elite class losing their position of power.

It is unclear how this item ended up on [[Petrichor V]], as it was never marked for interplanetary travel.
This could show how UES has a history of carelessly handling shipments.
