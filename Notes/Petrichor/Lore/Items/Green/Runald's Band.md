# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is part of the Band pair of items together with [[Kjaro's Band]].

The log resembles one half of a set of wedding vows, which is reinforced by the context in which the item is encountered first during gameplay: held by one of a pair of [[Elder Lemurian|Elder Lemurians]].

The full vows could be read as such:
<span class="lore"><span class="red">Should passion die down,</span>
<span class="blue">Should memories be lost,</span>
<span class="red">Should light be extinguished,</span>
<span class="blue">Should oceans be clouded,</span>
<span class="red">Will you bring me patience?</span>
<span class="blue">Will you bring me fervor?</span>
<span class="red">Will you die with me?</span>
<span class="blue">Will you die with me?</span></span>
The vows are called [[The Syzygy of Io and Europa]]. A Syzygy is an astronomical term referring to an opposition, typically between a sun and moon.

In this case, it refers to the opposition between [[Io]] and [[Europa]], moons of [[Jupiter]].
[[Europa]] is [[Jupiter|Jupiter's]] coldest moon and [[Io]] is the most volcanically active world in the solar system.
