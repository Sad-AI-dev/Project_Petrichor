# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Planula]] can be retrieved from a [[Grandparent]].

This log is a reference to the confusing nature of the lifecycle of the members in the [[Parent Family]].

The Cycle is as follows:
1. The [[Parent]] is hatched from the [[Planula]].
	1. The [[Parent]] cares for the [[Child|Children]] and [[Grandparent|Grandparents]].
2. The [[Parent]] grows up to be a [[Grandparent]].
	1. The [[Grandparent]] is in charge of incubating the [[Planula]].
3. The [[Grandparent]] eventually turns into the [[Child]].
	1. The [[Child]] lays the [[Planula]].

Simplified: [[Planula]] -> [[Parent]] -> [[Grandparent]] -> [[Child]]
