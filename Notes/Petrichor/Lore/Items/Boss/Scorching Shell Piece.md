Flames and ashes, nothing was meant to withstand the heat of the magma that surrounded me. Nothing but the immense creature I took down. A fragment, piece of its shell fell close enough to me that I was able to take it. Hot like the fire it was born in, it felt special. A reminder of what I am able to overcome.
