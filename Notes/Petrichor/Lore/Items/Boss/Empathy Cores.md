The [[Empathy Cores]] can be retrieved from a [[Solus Control Unit]].

The item summons the following 2 monsters to fight by the players side:
![[273px-Delighted_Probe_Gallery.webp|264]] ![[304px-Quiet_Probe_Gallery.webp|294]]
These are known as the [[Delighted Probe]] and [[Quiet Probe]] respectively.

The log appears to be a log from the perspective of a [[Solus Control Unit]], querying for `Mining Probes`, which refers to the [[Solus Probe]] enemy.
The query results in a large number of `VERY DEAD AND YELLOW` probes, 
in addition to the [[Delighted Probe]], described as `VERY BOLD AND GREEN AND LONELY`,
and the [[Quiet Probe]], described as `VERY COLD AND RED AND LONELY`.

The design of the [[Delighted Probe]] includes various [[Hopoo Feather]], vaguely resembling the modifications made to the [[Alloy Worship Unit]].

The design of the [[Quiet Probe]] includes red cloth, resembling those worn by the [[Heretic]]. Considering the [[Heretic|Heretic's]] similarity to the [[Alloy Vulture]], there may be a greater connection here.
