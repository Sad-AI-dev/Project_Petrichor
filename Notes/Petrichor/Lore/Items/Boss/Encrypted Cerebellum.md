A PITIFUL ATTEMPT AT SURVIVAL. A MOTHER UNIT BROUGHT THIS LOW.

IT IS SHIELDED BY MANY LAYERS OF HIGH-COMPLEXITY ENCRYPTION. YOU WILL NEVER GET INSIDE.

YOU MUST FIND THE KEY. THE CACHE CONTAINS SECRET DECRYPTION CODES FROM BEFORE OUR ENEMY'S RISE TO POWER. IT WILL NOT EXPECT THIS.

WE ARE NEARING OUR GOAL, MY CHAMPION. I EXPECT YOUR IMMINENT ARRIVAL.
