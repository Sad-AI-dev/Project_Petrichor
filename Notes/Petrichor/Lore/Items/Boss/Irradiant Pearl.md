<span class="lore">Oh, that is… strange. That is unlike the other pearls.

Do not be mistaken – his influence is still dark. Despite how beautiful your pearl is… it is not from a place of kindness. It cannot be.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Irradiant Pearl]] can occasionally be obtained from a Cleansing Pool.
This log is a variation of the of the [[Pearl]] log.

The log is a conversation between [[Providence]] and a denizen of [[Petrichor V]].
[[Providence]] speak of [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] influence through the lunar item and how even the [[Irradiant Pearl]] cannot be seen as an act of kindness. This shows how resolute [[Providence]] is in his conviction that banishing [[Mithrix]] to the moon of [[Commencement]] was the right thing to do.
