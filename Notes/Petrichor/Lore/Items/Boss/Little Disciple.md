<span class="lore">HELLO, LITTLE ONE. HOW WAS YOUR ADVENTURE TODAY?

OH

YOUR FORM IS BROKEN, LITTLE ONE. WHAT TRICKERIES HAVE YOU GOTTEN YOURSELF INTO?

OH

DO YOU TIRE OF ADVENTURE? 

WOULD YOU LIKE TO HELP ME TEND TO THE GARDEN, MY LITTLE ONE?

I UNDERSTAND. OH, YOUR FORM! DO NOT WORRY. COME CLOSER.

HERE - TWO COILS OF DENKU ROPE. THOSE ARE FOR STRENGTH.

HERE - FOUR CARDS OF OBSIDIAN. THOSE ARE FOR SELF-CONFIDENCE.

I GIVE YOU NOTHING FOR SPIRIT.

OH, DO NOT WORRY! WE WILL STILL GO ON ADVENTURES. THEY WILL BE QUIET ADVENTURES. 

COME CLOSER - CLOSER NOW. 

CLOSER!

NOW WATCH - WATCH CLOSELY.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Little Disciple]] can be retrieved from a [[Grovetender]].
This log is a conversation between a [[Grovetender]] and what is likely a [[Lesser Wisp]].

The log recounts the materials used to repair the [[Lesser Wisp]]. These materials, combined with a mask as established in the [[Lesser Wisp]] log, combine to create the [[Little Disciple]].
These are 2 coils of Denku rope and 4 cards of obsidian.

And thus the [[Lesser Wisp]] sticks with the [[Grovetender]], watching as it takes care of [[The Garden]].
