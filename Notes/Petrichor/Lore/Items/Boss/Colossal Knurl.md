There is obviously some essence left in this hunk; the Knurl is still attracting nearby earth and dirt, trying to reconstruct itself. Perhaps I can use this to my advantage; a self-repairing chunk of earth could serve as a good shield.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Colossal Knurl]] can be retrieved from a [[Colossus]].

The [[Colossal Knurl]] is a small fragment of a [[Colossus]], perhaps something close to a "heart". The knurl naturally attracts nearby chunks of earth, making it a good fit for a makeshift shield.
