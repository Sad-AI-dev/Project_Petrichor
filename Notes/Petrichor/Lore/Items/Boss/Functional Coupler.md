# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Functional Coupler]] can be retrieved from an [[Solus Amalgamator]].

The log is an internal log showing off the design highlights of the [[Functional Coupler]]. This is likely being requested by another member of the [[Solus Family]].

The design highlights explain how the [[Solus Amalgamator]] came to be: it gathers and integrates various other entities into itself, making them serve its `master directive` and allowing it to make use of the newly integrated entity.
It is possible that this ability is limited to members of the [[Solus Family]].
