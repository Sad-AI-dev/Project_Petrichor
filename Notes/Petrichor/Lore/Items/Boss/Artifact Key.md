# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">The key is incredibly simple. A stone crescent, with little discernable detail to the naked eye. But if one looks closer, with a sight beyond sight, they may notice the patterns inscribed on the key’s being. The patterns tell many things:

The key’s function: to unlock a lost trove of abandoned treasure.

The key’s creators: two brothers, one composed of ambition and the other compassion.

The key’s hopes: infused into the key, deep within its core, is a memory of better times, and the hope that one day, perhaps things could be better again.

The key’s reality: the bitter realization that such a reality exists only in the past.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Artifact Key]] is encountered in the [[Bulwark's Ambry]]. The key appears to be a simple stone crescent, but has intricate patterns transcribed into it's soul.

The key serves to unlock a lost trove of Artifacts: a series of powerful magical objects.
The key was created by [[Providence]] and [[Mithrix]].

The deeper meaning within the key shows how [[Providence]] wishes things could be like they once were, before [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] banishment to [[Commencement]].
