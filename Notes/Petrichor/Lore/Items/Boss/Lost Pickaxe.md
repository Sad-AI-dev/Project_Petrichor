# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Lost Pickaxe]] can be retrieved from the [[Direseeker]].
The [[Lost Pickaxe]] once belonged to the [[Miner]]. It is very likely that this item suggests that the [[Miner]] died in the [[Magma Barracks]] to the hands of the [[Direseeker]].

The address is identical to the [[Miner|Miner's]] address, suggesting that his recovered belongings are being send to his relatives.
