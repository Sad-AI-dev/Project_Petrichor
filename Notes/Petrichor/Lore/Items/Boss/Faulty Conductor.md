The [[Faulty Conductor]] can be retrieved from an [[Alloy Hunter]].
This is a dissection analysis file documenting the findings of [[C. Foreman]].

The artifact was obtained from an [[Alloy Hunter]], which is confirmed to be a unique member of the [[Alloy Vulture]] species. This makes it remarkably similar to the [[Heretic]].

The researcher notes similarities between the [[Faulty Conductor]] and `defense constructs`. These `defense contructs` may be in reference to the [[Construct Family]] or other members of the [[Solus Family]].

The [[Faulty Conductor]] serves as the tip of a spear, which is capable of shooting lasers and punching holes through a wall.
