Technician: Eleanor Veirs
Table Spec: Dissection 5B4 with Ele-Maintenance Kit
Notes: 

> Genesis Loop is highly conductive organ, contains conductive filaments stretching from one end to the other
> Both sides of loop have organelles at end; one has positive charge, one has negative charge
> Sticking ends of loop together generates voltage
> Connected loop and fed organ 50 volts
> Hair stood up on end, touching loop resulting in numbness in fingers
> Upping voltage to 100 volts
> Shooting arcs from organ, loop shudders and glows bright, dissonant humming is heard
> Upping voltage to 200 volts
> Bright flash, a loud crack as loop releases a blast that knocks me back
> Lights go out
> Dissection Table hardware damaged by voltage

The [[Genesis Loop]] can be retrieved from a [[Wandering Vagrant]].

Connecting the loop causes it to generate electricity, grow in vibrance and eventually release a powerful blast.
