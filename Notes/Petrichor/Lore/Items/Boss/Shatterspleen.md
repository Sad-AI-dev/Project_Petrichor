Subject: Shatterspleen
Technician:  Professor Mehri Daimera
Table Spec: Spillproof BDC-3
Notes:

> This will be my third attempt at a dissection of an Imp organ
> First attempt resulted in rupture
> Second attempt resulted in rupture
> Cutting into the outer layer produces copious amounts of fluid discharge
> As the fluid flows, the rest of the organ, inexplicably, swells
> Swelling will ultimately result in violent rupture
> Made use of the stemming tools on the BDC-3 to successfully proceed without incident
> Surprised to find sharp needle point objects (bones?) inside
> Timestamping for break
> Came back to leave some final notes
> Third attempt aborted after I injured my hand
> Eventually was able to stop my own bleeding. The organ seems to contain immense anticoagulant properties.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Shatterspleen]] can be retrieved from an [[Imp Overlord]].

The organ contains some kind of sharp bones. The organ swells and eventually violently explodes upon being damaged.
Contact with the organ results in intense and prolonged bleeding due to the anticoagulant properties from the organ.
