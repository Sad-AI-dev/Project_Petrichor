The [[Elite Aspects]] are a collection of items that resemble a morsel of power being granted by a higher power.

While it is unclear who granted this power, it is possible that this was granted by [[Providence]], due to the use of male pronouns and the healing effect of the power, which could be interpreted as compassioned.
