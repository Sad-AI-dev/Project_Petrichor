<span class="lore">"The inclusion of Rapid Response Drone Squadrons (RRDS) by local law enforcement marked a dire turning point of Plank's Rebellion. After its massive "success" in quelling the Rebellion - and subsequent implementation across Mercury - underground drone hackers became highly sought after by black market users."

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The log is a fragment of a text called [[Overview of Drone Technology, Vol.2]].

This chapter seems to cover the use of drones in the quelling of the [[Plank's Rebellion]] on [[Mercury]] by the local enforcement.
[[The Back-up]] can be used to call in a group of [[Strike Drone|Strike Drones]], which is an example of `Rapid Response Drone Squadrons (RRDS)`.

It is shows that the rebellion made heavy use of the black market, and that after RRDS was implemented by local enforcement, drone hackers became highly sought after.
It is possible that [[Operator]] is one such drone hacker.
