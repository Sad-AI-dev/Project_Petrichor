You really messed that up, didn't you? Dammit. The ****ing thing is bouncing, Harold. How the hell are we supposed to do ANYTHING with this? Now we will never know the truth. How - how did you even MANAGE to mess up this badly? Consider this useless hunk of grey matter your letter of termination. Keep the damn thing.

This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].

The [[Rotten Brain]] is an experiment gone horribly wrong. It seems that the sender intended to extract information from the reanimated brain.
