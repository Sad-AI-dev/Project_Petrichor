<span class="lore">Excerpt from the folk tale "Clean as Jade":

“... and while the peasants braced for the advancement of the Emperor’s army, the stone carver finished her last strike on the giant sculpture.

This log is an excerpt from the folk tale [[Clean as Jade]].

It seems the [[Jade Elephant]] is a reference to this folk tale, where a woman created a giant jade sculpture depicting an elephant. This sculpture emboldened the villagers and allowed them to fend off against the impeding army of the Emperor.

The log's format resembles that of the [[Defiant Gouge]] log, but seems to hold no further connection.
The log mainly points to a historical event that the [[Jade Elephant]] faintly echoes in the present day, almost like it may be a smaller fragment of the original sculpture, or it may be tapping into the same source of power.

The mention of an Emperor's army being fended off through a jade artifact vaguely resembles [[Providence|Providence's]] fight against the [[Imp Emporer|Imp Emporer's]] invading forces using his crystalline blade. Although this is likely unrelated, as the blade wielded by [[Providence]] is likely not made of jade.
