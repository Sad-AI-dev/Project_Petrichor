Shipping Details:

While the medical benefits of this creature are obvious, the psychological effects are not. Upon receiving a previous shipment, Carolyn took charge of research and experimentation with the organism. 

Everything was by the book until, one day, she walked into the lab with the specimen clearly attached to her neck. Incredibly startled, the rest of us eventually coaxed her into placing it back into containment.

We inspected the bite area but, after running all the standard tests, we did not observe any adverse side effects.

She stated that it made her feel fantastic, but no one else in the lab felt comfortable with her behavior.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Saturn]].

It seems that it's possible that the leach has both healing properties and the ability to convince the host to let it stay, thus creating a symbiotic relationship.

This item is possibly related to the [[Massive Leach]].
