While the medical benefits of this creature are obvious, the psychological effects are not. Upon receiving a previous shipment, Carolyn took charge of research and experimentation with the organism. 

Everything was by the book until, one day, she walked into the lab with the specimen clearly attached to her neck. Incredibly startled, the rest of us eventually coaxed her into placing it back into containment.

We inspected the bite area but, after running all the standard tests, we did not observe any adverse side effects.

She stated that it made her feel fantastic, but no one else in the lab felt comfortable with her behavior.</span>

It seems that it's possible that the leach has both healing properties and the ability to convince the host to let it stay, thus creating a symbiotic relationship.

This item is possibly related to the [[Massive Leach]].

Order Details:</span>
Giant leeches found in the pools of HYPERION-5. Very similar to its counterpart on Earth, but it seems to have developed teeth as well, allowing it to eat meat as well as siphon blood.  
  
A few have been spotted to balloon to enormous proportions, up to the size of a small dog. Like the common leech, this has obvious medical implications. You will just have to be extra careful, or you may come back to no patient and a giant bloody leech.
