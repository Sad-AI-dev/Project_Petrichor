The [[Elite Aspects.canvas|Elite Aspects]] are a collection of items that resemble a morsel of power being granted by a higher power.

It is unclear who granted this power, as no known greater entity is connected to the concept of incorporeality. It could theoretically be [[Providence]], but there is no evidence suggesting this is the case.
