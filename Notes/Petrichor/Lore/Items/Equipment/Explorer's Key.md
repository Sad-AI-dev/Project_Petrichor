Order Details:</span>
Strange artifact. Seems to be made of nano-technology, allowing it to solidify and liquify at will. I have yet to find a lock this key cannot open. Highly Illegal I imagine..  
  
Has opened traditional lock and bolt, card readers, eye scanners, dead bolts, chains, zippers, and my phone password.  
I expect a hefty sum for this, because otherwise.. well.. your guild will simply become obsolete because of one key.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This is being shipped to [[Mercury]].

The [[Explorer's Key]] is a piece of nano-technology designed to open any lock. This is not only traditional locks, but any object or software designed to prevent an individual from passing.

As the log mentions, such an item must be highly illegal and would render the `Merchants Guild` entirely obsolete. This suggests that the purpose of the `Merchants Guild` is likely, in part, storing and protecting specific items.
