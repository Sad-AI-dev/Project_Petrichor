Another one for you folks. You liked the previous shipment so much, I thought I would send you more outdated tech. When I say outdated, I MEAN outdated. This thing triggers from plunging; while it still uses microwave signals to connect between sticks of dynamite, it is otherwise the same as the classics.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].
The address is identical to the address the [[Heaven Cracker]] is being shipped to.

It is possible that the [[Dynamite Plunger]] was send by the same company that provided the [[Heaven Cracker]]. This seems plausible as both items could be used in a mining operation.
