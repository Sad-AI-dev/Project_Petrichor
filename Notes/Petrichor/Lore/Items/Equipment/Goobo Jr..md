"I'm telling you, you need to be more strict with your little slime project, dude. I caught him rummaging through my stuff earlier. You know how hard it is to get stains out of these UES uniforms? "

"His NAME is Goobo Jr., thank you very much. And I'm sure he was just playing. He likes his uncle Rich, isn't that right, Goobo?"

"It doesn't have vocal chords, Mike."

"You don't have vocal chords."

"Real mature. Anyway, you better stop messing around, or the Captain will send that slime ball to the front lines. Now, I got to go do my job. Y'know, what we were sent here for, not playing dollhouse with your ‘science project' over here."

<span class="lore-mono">[THIS LOG HAS BEEN FLAGGED FOR REVIEW AS PART OF: COURT MARTIAL OF RICHARD D. BAGGINS]</span></span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is a transcription of a conversation between [[Richard D. Baggins]] and a survivor called `Mike` which was recorded aboard the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED].]]

This fragment has been flagged for review by the military court in a case against [[Richard D. Baggins]].

The log shows that [[Goobo Jr.]] was created as a science experiment. It's main consistency is described as `slime` and it leaves stains.
Uniforms supplied by UES have a quirk resulting in stains being hard to remove from them.

[[Goobo Jr.]] was likely created by a survivor named `Mike`. [[Goobo Jr.]] is incapable of speech, but can mimic any creature at will. In order for [[Goobo Jr.]] to take on the appearance of another creature, it must observe if for a short period of time.

It is unclear what [[Goobo Jr.]] was instructed to do while taking on the appearance of [[Richard D. Baggins]], but it is possible that this is what caused him to be the subject of a court martial.
