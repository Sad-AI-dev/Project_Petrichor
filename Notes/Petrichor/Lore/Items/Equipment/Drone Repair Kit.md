We have learned from nature that the best relationships are the symbiotic ones; the nanodrones go and fix up all the scratches and broken pieces of the attack drones, and in return they get scrap metal to replicate. Win-win for both.

This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].
The address is identical to the address the [[Thqwib]] is being shipped to.

The [[Drone Repair Kit]] is actually a containment unit for a swarm of nanodrones, which can be released to repair nearby damaged equipment. The swarm uses left-over metal scraps from this repair process to replicate themselves.
