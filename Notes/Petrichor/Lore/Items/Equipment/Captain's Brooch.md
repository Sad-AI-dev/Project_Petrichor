Order Details:</span>
The brooch has been passed down for many generations in my family, signifying the new captain of Contact Light. I'll actually be personally delivering this back to my home, so mark it as high priority.  
  
..hmm? There is a very small button on the back. Pressing it seems to do nothing...
