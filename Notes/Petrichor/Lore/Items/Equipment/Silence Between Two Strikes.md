The [[Elite Aspects.canvas|Elite Aspects]] are a collection of items that resemble a morsel of power being granted by a higher power.

It is unclear who granted this power, as no major entities are generally connected with the theme of lightning. The strongest known entity connected to lightning is the [[Overloading Worm]], but it is unlikely that they are the entity responsible for giving this power.

It is technically possible that this power it also gifted by [[Providence]], but there is nothing explicitly suggesting this is the case.
