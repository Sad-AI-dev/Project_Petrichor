Oh great [hero],

thou saved us from our doom,

and for that we give praise.

Thy compassion boundless,

I humbly ask for your help again.

Deliver me from misfortune,

Protect me from my enemies,

And allow me to bask in your radiance once more.

This log is a transcription of an image found on [[Petrichor V]], created by the [[FIELDTECH Image-To-Text Translator (v2.5.10b)]].

This introduced [[FIELDTECH]] as a tech company in the Risk of Rain universe.

The transcription resembles a prayer from the denizens of [[Petrichor V]] to their savior: [[Providence]].
It is unclear if this happens after the events of the [[UES Contact Light]].
