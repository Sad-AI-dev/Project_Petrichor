Use for focus lasers, I assume. Anyways, this is the biggest one I could find ANYWHERE. Outside of the Crown Amethyst of Venus, which I obviously can't get you, this is the best for your purposes. You'll be able to reach AMAZING quality with this; good luck!

The [[Gigantic Amethyst]] is a massive chunk of amethyst to be used in a scientific experiment likely involving focusing off a laser.

The `Crown Amethyst of Venus` is mentioned. This is likely the largest known amethyst crystal ever discovered. The name suggests that it was found on [[Venus]] and still belongs to the local governing body of the planet.
