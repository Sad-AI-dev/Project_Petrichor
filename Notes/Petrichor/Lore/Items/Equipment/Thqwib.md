Thqwibs naturally live in very low atmosphere, so the pressurized container is for their own safety. If released into the room, they'll die immediately, so don't.  
  
I included approximately 30 thqwibs; despite their similar appearance to other creatures, they are naturally social and will become depressed if left alone.
