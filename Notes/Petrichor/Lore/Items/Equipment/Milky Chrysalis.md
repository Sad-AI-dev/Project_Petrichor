Deep within the plague wastes there is an alcove free from disease. It is home to a group of insects that have NOT acclimated to their environment. They survive not through resistance… but through transformation. 

I’ve witnessed the creatures undergoing infinite states of metamorphosis. Each change that happens to them is reflected in the surrounding land. This constantly molds the area into something less toxic.

I can’t imagine that they don’t have an upper limit - a final form. What adjustments would that final form bring? Are there any restrictions to what can be modified? I’m sending this sample to you to study. Please be careful with it, as it’s frozen in a cryo cell mid-transformation.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is a biological sample being sent to a research center on [[Io]].

It is unclear what species this sample belongs to, but it makes it's home in a location within the `plague wastes`. It is not clear where this is located.

The insect species is unique for it's ability to go through a metamorphosis a seemingly unlimited number of times, each time changing itself (and seemingly it's surrounding area?) each time.

It is theorized that this species may have a perfected final form.
