You’re asking for trouble, ordering this through the UES. Not very covert. This thing can put out anything from infrared to UV waves – maybe it’ll let you see the Enforcers coming to haul you off to jail as they kick down your door! Hah!</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Mercury]].

The possession of this item is highly illegal, and shipping it through UES was a very bad idea. This suggests that individuals who want to maintain a low profile tend to avoid using UES and that UES works together with local law enforcements.
Many illegal and / or suspicious items are known to be shipped by UES, putting into question the consistency at which UES reports these type of items.

It is mentioned that [[Enforcer|Enforcers]] coming to haul you off to jail is an expected consequence for breaking the law.
