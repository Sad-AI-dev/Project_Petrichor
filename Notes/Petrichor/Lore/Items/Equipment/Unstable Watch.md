Doesn't work at all..! Sometimes it keeps time fine, and sometimes it sends me for a tizzy! I can be watchin' (haha) it and I'll see it jump 10 seconds, sometimes 15. No mater what I do it keeps doin' it, and I have no idea why. Luck for ya!  
I gotta go sit down.. feelin a bit tired..

This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].

The [[Unstable Watch]] is a watch that occasionally jumps a handful of seconds ahead. Being near it unnaturally tires out the holder, suggesting it is in some ways effecting time or the perception of it.
