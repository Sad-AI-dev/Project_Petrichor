While intended for anti-artillery use, the ONI-CV117 has become wildly popular in the private sector as both a personal and automobile defence device. By protecting the user in 'hard light' that closely wraps around, shock is absorbed throughout the light, rather than by the user. However, the shield generator requires time to charge, meaning it has a short uptime. Time it wisely.

This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].

The official title of the [[Shield Generator]] is `ONI-CV117`. The [[Shield Generator]] is a much stronger version of the [[Personal Shield Generator]]. The [[Shield Generator]] achieves its heightened effect by use of `hard light`, the same technology used by the [[Hardlight Afterburner]].

The main flaw of the [[Shield Generator]] is its short uptime.
