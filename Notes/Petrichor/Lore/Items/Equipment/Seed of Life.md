# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">Thick evening mist wraps the Queen like a sentient cloak. "Children, tonight we show these wretched demons our grief. Fight and fall and fight again. Take his [blessing] and go.”
A stream of Beetles march up the dead tree’s hollow. A Beetle Guard stops to face an alcove and it’s units pause behind him, antennae twitching. The Guard crosses it’s front legs above it’s head, "Deathless are we.", it sticks a pronged seed to it’s underbelly.
On the surface, Beetles pour from lifeless stumps in neat lines. A thousand forms shrink into the Eastern horizon in a golden thread.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log follows the perspective of a [[Beetle Queen]], sending her troops to march against the survivors of the [[UES Contact Light]]. It is suggested that [[Providence]] is still alive at the time this event takes place.
This is noteworthy, as the [[Beetle Family]] does not appear in the first game. This log thus suggests that we simply don't encounter them in the first game, but they are present lore-wise.

The [[Beetle Queen]] received multiple copies of the [[Seed of Life]] directly or indirectly from [[Providence]], and gives one to a [[Beetle Guard]].

It is explored that mist can reach the [[Beetle Queen]], that the [[Beetle Queen]] calls a hollow space within a dead tree her home and that the beetles have a large sprawling network underground leading up to the surface and that this network includes many lifeless stumps.
