I wish you hadn't asked me for help. I was contacted by [REDACTED] and they explained... well, some things. Using their instructions, I was able to design this interface for prolonged exactness. The beauty of it all is that it will compound with any previous precision enhancing tools. Digital plus optical is the way to go.

While I still don't know everything, I feel like I'm already in too deep. You won't hear from me anymore after this.</span>

This item is being shipped to [[Earth]].

It seems that the [[Ocular HUD]] is a modified piece of technology that was created by a criminal organization who likely blackmailed a scientist into cooperating with them.
