Here’s a replacement for your damaged equipment. Crazy how gang activity is starting up again – even crazier that they’d steal a capacitor from you guys. Anyway, you guys know the drill – make sure to routinely discharge the capacitor’s storage cells, as it may hold on to latent voltage. Oh, and make sure not to point it at anybody when you do.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to a power plant on [[Venus]].

The full name of the item is `ZAP2-K "Royal" Capacitor`.

It appears a similar item was stolen from the power plant by a group simply referred to as a `gang`. This may indicate rising tension on [[Venus]].
