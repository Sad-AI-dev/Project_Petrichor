Yet another antique. I don't get the hype around melees, they are just kind of boring.  
I think the point of this one was to hit harder but any cannon would just be more efficient at that.  
Anyway, who am I to judge, right?

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].

The sender doesn't understand the hype surrounding melee weapons, believing that more sophisticated ranged weaponry would be much more efficient.

It is possible that this is a commonly held believe.
