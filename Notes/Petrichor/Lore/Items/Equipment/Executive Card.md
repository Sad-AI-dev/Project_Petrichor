"When you're on the planet, keep a look out for any loose UES Security Chests. Orders from the higher ups, we're to retrieve any and all parcels that were aboard the Contact Light and bring 'em home. When you locate them, open the Security Chest and retrieve the item within. When you've verified the contents of the chest, move out and continue with your other assignments. Understood?"

"Sir yes sir! But how are we going to open them? They're locked tight, aren't they?"

"A good question, soldier. Everyone, take one Executive Credit Card, then pass the tray to your next squad mate."

"What? No. You don't pay it back."

"But aren't we borrowing money?"'

The log is a fragment of a conversation that took place on the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED].]]
The conversation contains instructions for the participants of the [[UES [REDACTED]|UES [REDACTED] ]]mission.
