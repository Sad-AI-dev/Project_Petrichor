MED-E, the medical bot, has been working overtime. The survivors felt very grateful that their escape pod landed near Med Bay cargo - they would have most likely perished without it.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is likely a conversation between the a medical bot called [[MED-E]] and an [[Enforcer]].
The dark blue combat helmet and shotgun highly suggest this.

It is likely this log talks about survivors from the [[UES Contact Light]].
