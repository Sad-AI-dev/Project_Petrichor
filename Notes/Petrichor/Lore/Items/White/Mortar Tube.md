Well, uh.. it's a little outdated. You stick explosives down the end, then you fire the explosive. With more explosives. If you're trying to reduce your injury rate, don't use these.  
  
Other than its archaic design, the mortar tube is actually pretty decent if you get a lot of them in a battery. Can blanket a big area, like [REDACTED]. I suppose you can beat them with the tube afterwards.
