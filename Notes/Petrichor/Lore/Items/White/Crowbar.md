“Hey, toss me a crowbar?”

Jesse walked over to the toolbox and rummaged around. Plucking a crowbar from the container, she went over to James.

“Thanks,” he grunted, attempting to pry the chest open. Jesse sat herself on the table next to James, idly watching him work. “I swear, this had to be the one chest that CAN’T be paid open... Crash must have... broken the circuitry inside.” James mumbled to himself.

“Yeah.” Jesse looked around, her eyes falling on a palette of chests that had been recovered from the recent expeditions. Sighing, she hopped to her feet. “I’m heading to the mess hall. Want anything?” 

“Yeah, how about a better crowbar? This thing is only a second edition.” James stretched, tossing the crowbar over his shoulder. Patting the still unopened chest, he chuckled. “It’s good, but to be honest… it’s getting a little old.”

Jesse laughed.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log contains a recording between two survivors on the [[UES [REDACTED] |UES [REDACTED],]] Jesse and James.

The log establishes that chests can get damaged to the point they can no longer be opened through purchase.

The conversation likely took place after the [[UES [REDACTED] ]]arrived on [[Petrichor V]]. It is unclear if the [[UES [REDACTED] ]] has crashed at this point.
