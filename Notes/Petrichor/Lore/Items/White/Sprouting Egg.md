This egg seems to be somewhere between hatching and dying. Leaving it undisturbed usually causes it to wiggle around a bit, maybe sticking a tendril out. Trying to remove it from its shell is greeted by the most horrible screetching!  
  
I can't bring it to myself to cook it alive. I don't know what to do with it, so here you go; maybe it will hatch in a warmer climate like yours. As useless as he is, I have grown a bit fond of him. Please take care!

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].

The [[Sprouting Egg]] is in a bizarre state between hatching and dying.
Attempting to remove the shell causes the unhatched creature inside to screech.

It may be possible to hatch the egg in a warmer environment.
