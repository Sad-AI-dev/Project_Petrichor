Shipping Details:

I don't trust UESC. Not one bit. Their Security Chests? Full of overrides and backdoors- I've got a cousin working in their factory, and they've got all kinds of weird things going on in those chests. I've seen so many of them in auctions - for the lost and unclaimed ones - and you just pay money, and it springs open on the spot. Are you kidding me?

Anyways, I'm sending you exactly what I said I would - but it's too important to leave the security up to the UESC. So I'm sending the key to you - and the lockbox to Margaret. Like a two-factor authentication. Let me know when you get this.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Earth]].
The log establishes that the UES Corporation is very untrustworthy and their security chests can be opened through purchased ones marked missing or unclaimed.

UES also owns the factory that produces the security chests.
