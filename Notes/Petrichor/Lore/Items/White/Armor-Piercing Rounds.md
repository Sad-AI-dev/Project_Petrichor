Alright, just to clarify, these rounds aren’t faulty. Heck, I’d say they’re better than the standard, but... that’s kind of the problem. I don’t know if it was a new shipment of materials, or a problem with the assembly line, but these rounds are supposed to pierce armor. Not pierce through the armor, five feet of reinforced concrete, a few warehouses, and an armored truck. 

Could you guys look into this so we don’t like, violate any Geneva Conventions or anything?</span>
# <span class="lore-title">Notes</span>
The armor-piercing rounds is a shipment of bullets capable of piercing most materials. The shipment is likely a return to sender, meaning that the producer of these rounds is located in the [[Jonesworth System]].

The existence of the Geneva Conventions is mentioned, suggesting that it is still in effect.
