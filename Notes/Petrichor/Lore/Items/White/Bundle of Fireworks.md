<span class="lore">"Hey, happy anniversary!

You really thought I forgot?

Ah, I thought I was the dumb one in our relationship. 
C'mon T, of course not! 
Well, I wasn't going to let a little alien death planet ruin our night. Right? 
Shh, just watch. Just watch. It's okay. Just watch. You'll love it - you really will. Then we can go home.

You can keep your eyes closed. Just listen. Ah - here it comes! In five... four... three... two... ONE...!"</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log contains a conversation between two survivors in a relationship. They celebrate their anniversary by lighting fireworks.
It is unclear which expedition these survivors where a part of, but they remain hopeful about returning home.
One of the individuals is referred to as `T`.

It is unclear if this individual is responsive or if the log simply covers only one half of the conversation.

Yeah, celebration! Bought these from a friend, forgot where he said he got them. I'm glad that we finally re-legalized residential use of fireworks in 2054 after the... well, the terrorist attacks. Disguising homing missiles as fireworks? Don't ever quote me on it, but it was pretty smart. Anyways, these are for your kids to use. Have fun!

This item is being shipped to [[Earth]].

It appears that fireworks were re-legalized in 2054 after they were banned due to a series of terrorist attacks where homing missiles were disguised as fireworks.

This confirms that the events of the [[UES Contact Light]] take place after 2054.
