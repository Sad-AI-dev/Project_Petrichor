Order details:
Let’s wrap this up, the General is not a patient man.
I’m leaving your order in the locker you specified.

I expect full payment, or I’ll hire some Grey Guilders to count the gold straight from your pocket.

Before the General hunted a bigger set for himself, this pair was …favored… in the field. Only put these under a microscope if you want trouble sleeping.

I’ve tried many hemo-scrubs but whatever makes these so sturdy also made it impossible to clean entirely. I’ve attached some nano tech (not cheap!) to the device to let it through the UES bio-scanners. The rest is up to you.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The Elusive Antlers are being send to a researcher on [[Mercury]].
This log introduces the [[Grey Guilds]], a collective of individuals who take on sketchy jobs, effectively the equivalent to thieve guilds in traditional fantasy settings.

Money is referred to as `gold`, suggesting that currency is still physical and may contain gold.

The elusive antlers once belonged to a wild alien animal, and is entirely organic in nature.
