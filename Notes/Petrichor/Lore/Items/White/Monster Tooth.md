“Hey, nice duds! Where’d you grab those?”

“Oh, this old thing? I’ve been making it, actually.”

“Making it?”

“Yeah, well, I found the first tooth in one of the chests. But every time we go out on patrol, we typically run into more of those aliens. Once we take care of ‘em, I try to pick myself out a souvenir. Y’know, to add to my collection.”

“Wow, uh… Is that like, allowed? I feel like that’s not allowed.”

“Eh, what the captain doesn’t know won’t hurt him. Besides, it IS cool, right?”

“I guess so. I’ll be honest man, that’s creepy as hell… but hey, do you have any more string? I might start one of my own.”</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is a recording of a conversation between 2 survivors on board the [[UES [REDACTED] |UES [REDACTED].]]
It is established that hierarchy is still in-place after landing on [[Petrichor V]], as the pair questions if their actions are "allowed", and fear repercussion from their Captain.

The monster tooth item is partially made out of tooth collected from monsters on [[Petrichor V]].

Ripped it RIGHT out of 'is mouth! A big fight that one gave me, I tell ya! Wrestled me right down, jaws wrapped around my head! Good thing Bishop here got him with that vaporiser, eh? Hahaha!  
  
It's been my good luck charm for a while, but hey, with the money you're payin' for it I'll give 'er up. Sometimes I feel like it helped me on hunts though, ya know? Like.. instincts.
