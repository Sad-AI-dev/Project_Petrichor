<span class="lore">Heavy losses were expected – after all, the invaders were as cunning as they were deadly. 

The dust had at last settled. The Golems had returned to the earth, and the Lemurians had returned to their tunnels. It was a long and grueling battle, but they had won. The invaders had been purged.

The only proof of their last stand was a single banner, fluttering in the wind, flying over a mountain of corpses.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log covers the last stand of a group of survivors on [[Petrichor V]], who died in a battle against [[Stone Golem|Stone Golems]] and [[Lemurian|Lemurians]], only leaving the banner in their wake.

Very very valuable. Don't drop it; it's worth more than you.  
  
What is it? Well, are you blind? It's obviously a warbanner from the War of 2019 from one of the rebel groups. Yes, maybe a little overdramatic, but inspiring nonetheless. They say - they say that warbanners won the war for them. Gave them.. magical strength.
