This one is from your uncle. It's interesting that after these years, nobody else took the classic hand buzzer to the next level, it's only natural! Of course, it's way more than a prank toy, and it goes without saying you have to be careful. It could kill a whole namooth!  
He says you'd have a lot of fun with it, so... do your thing.
