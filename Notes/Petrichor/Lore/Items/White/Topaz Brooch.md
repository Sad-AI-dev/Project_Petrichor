Shipping Details:

The locker combination is 33941. Inside the package, besides your standard equipment, you will find the brooch. The appearance of this item is meant to blend in at the party. Pin it to your body and the software inside will map your extents. Activation will briefly cover you in ultra-phasic shielding.

When you have taken out the target, the shield will switch on to protect you from any immediate retaliation measures they have installed in the security system. If the time frame is not enough to make your escape, the shield can be... reactivated, but we’d like to keep casualties to a minimum.

Good luck.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being send to [[Venus]], likely to some kind of secret agent.

The topaz brooch is meant to disguise the shielding capabilities of the gadget inside. It is suggested that in order for the item to be activated, someone must be killed, much like is seen during gameplay.
