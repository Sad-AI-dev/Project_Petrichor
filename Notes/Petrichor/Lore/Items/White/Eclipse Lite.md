Project G Commercial - Draft #05

"Man, killing these aliens has got me all tuckered out. I could sure use a drink that restores my energy AND quenches my thirst!" Jean exclaimed as he finished off some Lemurians. "But what could I find on this hostile alien planet?" Out of the corner of his eye, Jean spots his saving grace - an Eclipse Lite, mercifully undamaged in an open crate. "Eureka!" Jean scooped up the perspiring bottle and hastily unscrewed the cap. Taking a swig, Jean exclaimed in joy. "Wow, not only is it delicious, it's full of electrolytes! It's what thirsty soldiers on alien planets crave! Thank you Eclipse Zero, bravely frontiering new worlds of flavor!"
