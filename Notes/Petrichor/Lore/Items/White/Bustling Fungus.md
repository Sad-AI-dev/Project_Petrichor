“You have a problem.”

“What? How? These are good for me, they…”

“Yeah, they help promote cell repair, carbon neutral, blah blah blah… I’ve heard that spiel a thousand times already. Whether they’re good for you or not, you can’t just have a diet consisting only of them. It’s basic dietary science!”

“So what?”

“So what? Eating only mushrooms isn’t healthy, just like eating only meat or vegetables isn’t healthy!”

“Oh, so you’re attacking vegetarians, now?”

“Wh- No! I just mean--”

“Well, when you’re a bit more tolerant of my lifestyle, I’d be glad to continue this conversation with you. Until then, I’d suggest you open your heart and appetite to a more… fungal… palette.”</span>

Order Details:</span>
The strongest biological healing agent.. is a mushroom. Found in an abandoned house. I find some humor in that.  
This fungus has developed an amazing defense mechanism of hiding underground when bothered, allowing it to live long enough to distribute spores.  
  
Can be either ground into a paste or.. planted directly into the wound. A small warning; you'll feel it enter you, and it is every bit as unpleasant as it sounds.

Bizarrely, this item is marked as an estimated delivery in `1753`.

The fungus can be ground into a paste or directly planted upon a wound in order to make use of its healing property. The sensation of this process is rather unpleasant.
