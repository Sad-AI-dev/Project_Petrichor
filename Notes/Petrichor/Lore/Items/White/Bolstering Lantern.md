<span class="lore">To proceed with construction of our [hope], we must master the powers of this temple, and so, regrettably-

ONE DESECRATED FRAGMENT, STOLEN FROM A HOLY STRUCTURE.

To proceed is already difficult, I wish you wouldn’t say it like that-

I WATCH THE SLOW LEMURIAN CARVE PROTECTIVE RUNES.

-…I see you’ll be testing my patience in this collaboration.

LET US BEGIN.

I see a fine light, but we’re hoping to use it for strength when we’re wound-

A PALM OF AMETHYST DUST – THIS IS FOR STRENGTH.
A PINCH OF [powder] – THIS IS FOR S-.

Stop stop! We are not ready to introduce Soul yet, it’s unstable. We want something to make us, and our [hope], stronger.

HOW WILL IT MAKE FRIENDS WITHOUT SOUL, ELDER ONE?</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The log covers a conversation between an [[Elder Lemurian]] and a [[Grovetender]]. The pair is in the process of creating the [[False Son]].
The \[power\] mentioned is likely for spirit. This same powder is used by a [[Grovetender]] in the [[Lesser Wisp]] and [[Greater Wisp]] logs.

The `desecrated fragment` likely refers to the [[Bolstering Lantern]] itself.

The log also shows that the [[Wisp Family]] and [[Lemurian Family]] are capable of communicating and cooperating when unified by their reverence of [[Providence]].
