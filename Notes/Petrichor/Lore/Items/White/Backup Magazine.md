It's not much, but our damaged spares in the back of the warehouse should be better than nothing. I'm really putting myself in a bad spot doing this outside of regulations, but the treaties make it tough to send out the good stuff. I can't let my buddies just die out there because of some big-wigs who are afraid to get the job done.  
Give em a few smacks before loading and fire a shot or two inside before trusting the mags. Good luck out there. At least we haven't seen any restrictions on the meds.

This item is being shipped to [[Venus]].

It appears that there is an active conflict on [[Venus]]. A sort of peace treatise has been established by a small group of individuals referred to as `big-wigs`. Due to this, it's hard to send militaristic aid to those fighting in the war. There is no such restriction on medication.
