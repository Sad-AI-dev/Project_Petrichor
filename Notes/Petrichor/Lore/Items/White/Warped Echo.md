Lab Dissection Analysis File
Subject: Warped Echo
Technician: Eleanor Veirs
Table Spec: Mineral Analysis with Kinetic Soak Gauntlets
- A smooth circle, cold to the touch. I probably shouldn’t have touched it.
- Using kinetic gloves, I’ll chisel a piece of the large dark polished ’crystal’ for testing.
- No use. heavy equipment can’t get the crystal to fracture
- I resentfully observe it intact under a powerful microscope.
- Despite it’s structured form, compound seems organically created and new to our databases.
- Carbon indicates this pre-dates the Europan ocean. Barely.
- My assistant Claire claps me on the back before heading to lunch, I barely feel it.
- Later I felt an impact on my back in the same spot she touched me.
- Finally, a breakthrough. We grin like wolves.
Claire brings her lunch into the lab (not recommended, but delicious).
I was about to send this boring thing off to Kosta for appraisal, but now we have work to do.</span>
