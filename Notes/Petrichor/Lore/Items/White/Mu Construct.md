...And I thought everything on this planet was out to kill me.  
Once I found it, it wouldn't stop following me. It's very curious about shiny objects and has taken to spinning whenever I am trying to rest. It simply doesn't want to stand still.  
It's pushy, but this far away from home I find the company very soothing.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Saturn]] and was found on [[Petrichor V]] by a survivor of the [[UES Contact Light]].

The [[Mu Construct]] follows the survivor wherever they go, and the survivor finds this rather soothing.
The naming convention and the title of the unlock requirement `Pre-Alpha` suggests that the [[Mu Construct]] is likely a young member of the [[Construct Family]] and that it is a precursor to the [[Alpha Construct]].
