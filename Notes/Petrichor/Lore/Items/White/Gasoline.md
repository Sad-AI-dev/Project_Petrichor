[Fire crackling]

MAN 1: D-do you think they're gonna come for us?

MAN 2: They'll try. It's going to be a very long while.

MAN 1: What? Why?

MAN 2: A long while. Even if they know where to look we'd be months out from the nearest port. And that's if they even have any ships as fast as ours – FTL ships are very rare nowadays.

MAN 1: Months...?! And what do you mean if they know where? What about the other ships on our shipping routes?

MAN 2: We weren't on the route.

[Fire pops]

MAN 1: What?!

MAN 2: We should've been halfway to Procyon by the time we crashed... but we weren’t. The ship never announced it was slowing down either, so that’ll make triangulating our positions even harder.

MAN 1: I-I don't get it. Who would take a UES train off course? That's completely insane!

MAN 2: I don’t know – only the Captain does. There’s no reason to slow down in this star system - there's not even supposed to be a habitable planet out here.

[Sizzling]

MAN 2: This looks cooked to me. Can't vouch for how it'll taste - but we have to eat.

MAN 1: I... I can't even think right now. I’m not hungry.

MAN 2: Eat. We've got a lot of traveling to do tomorrow and we'll need to keep our strength.

MAN 1: Sure. Okay. Okay. Um… do you think it's poisonous?

MAN 2: Eat.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log covers a conversation between 2 survivors of the [[UES Contact Light]].
The log establishes that the [[UES Contact Light]] went off course before crashing on [[Petrichor V]], and was supposed to be on route to [[Procyon]].

Additionally, the log establishes that the [[UES Contact Light]] is capable of FTL (Faster Than Light) travel, and that this is very rare in space ships. This results in it potentially taking months before help arrives.

Gasoline, eh? Surprising to find a gas station these days, with everyone drivin' around them electro cars.  
Got yourself quite a few gallons, so for the few cars and planes left runnin on gas.. this should do it!  
Very flammable, even the fumes, so be careful now!
