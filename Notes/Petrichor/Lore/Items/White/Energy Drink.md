Yeah, so, uh this is the um, the energy drink that people were mixing during that disaster in Majora Minora a few weeks ago. 

A quick toxicology test on some of the victims has come back positive for um... all kinds of stuff, really. Methadone, phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol, a variety of opiates, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines... the list just goes on and on and on.

Radical Drinks is insisting that NONE of those were from their energy drink - which I find pretty uh, unlikely. Maybe they REALLY know how to party in Violet Heights, huh?</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The energy drink is being send for inspection on [[Venus]] and was send from a location called [[Violet Heights]].
The NR-G sports drink likely contains an extensive list of illegal substances.
