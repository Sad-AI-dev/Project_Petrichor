Order details:
General Reid,
I examined the devices you sent me and sure enough your unit has been getting WAY too much phencyclidine in their doses. That may explain them trying to eat each other. I’ve lowered the threshold by 15%.

On the bright side, their hand eye coordination has been off the charts. Given the right gun, these soldiers could strike a jet from the ground.

If this trial goes well, and their lungs return to normal, I’ll clear them for duty.
