<span class="lore-text">Chance on hit to attach a bomb to enemies.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">In the blaring heat, a silhouette could be seen, hiding in the cool shade of a nearby cave. She was waiting for the sandstorm to pass.

She heard a noise and turned around, recognizing another silhouette. It bounded into the cave with excitement. As the figure got closer, she alarmingly noticed the cargo.

"Woah, what the hell?! Why are you holding like, fifty bombs? Get away from me! "

"What! We need these – this planet is trying to kill us! "

"You’re a walking bomb. Those are so unstable. Get away! Where did you even find those things? "

"I found an industrial 3D printer nearby, and it was assigned to the blueprints of these bombs. Awesome, right? Unlimited bombs!"

"…What materials?"

"Huh?"

"What materials did you put in? We barely had anything."

"I just put in everything."</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log covers an interaction between 2 survivors in a desert. This could potentially be the same desert seen in [[Abandoned Aqueduct]].

The log shows that industrial 3D printers are assigned to a blueprint and accept almost any material.

Jesus, okay. The only reason I'm sending you guys another shipment is because of what you did for Shelby. Consider that debt paid.  
  
Since you APPARENTLY didn't get my message the first time, I'll tell you again. See the orange end? Don't touch it. Once you take the wrapping off, the adhesive is ACTIVE. DON'T TOUCH IT. YOU STICK THAT END ON BAD THINGS, NOT YOURSELF.  
  
The cadets? Those lives are on you, not me.
