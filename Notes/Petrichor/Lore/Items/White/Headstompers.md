Have you found the kill-count of your shoes to be 0? Do you find that disturbing? So do we. Combat Ready Spikeshoes, lovingly nicknamed 'Headstompers,' allow you to get the drop on foes. Literally. Vertically.  
  
Titanium-tipped spikes, along with steel soles, guarantee that landing on foes will result in the messiest recreation of old school video games that you have ever seen. NOTE: Spikes deploy only after reaching a certain vertical velocity.
