This log was generated by the [[DataScraper (v3.1.53 - beta branch)]] program.

While the item is called [[Quick Fix]], the recipe refers to it as `Dubious Meal`.
Clearly something went wrong in the data scraping process, but the ingredients listed are extremely nonsensical.

Highlights are:
- `3 Kilograms of enriched Uranium 235`
- `"tablespoons" of chocolate`
- `1 Human Lung`
- `2 BILLION servings of white rice`

The final ingredient is unfinished, but lists `-5` servings.

The flavor texts notes that the meal is `full of minerals`, which could very well point towards it's ingredients including enriched Uranium, or that the meal is cooked using [[Item Scrap]] during gameplay.
