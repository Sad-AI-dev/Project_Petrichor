<span class="lore">A world without end.

A world protected.

Hosts shadowed by oblivion, reigned in.

All for the life of a worm.

In the worlds without,

Where are their guardians to guide them?

Where will their souls go, in the end?

Why let chaos rule, when power can decide?

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log was written by an unknown author.

The contents of the log are a vague allegory for [[Petrichor V]] and it's rulers: [[Providence]] and [[Mithrix]].

`A world without end. A world protected.` likely refers to [[Petrichor V]] and the fact that it's rulers will prevent it from ever "ending".

`Hosts shadowed by oblivion, reigned in.` This likely refers to the [[Space Sickness]] experienced by both [[Providence]] and [[Mithrix]].

`All for the life of a worm.` The worm here likely references to the [[Mithrix]] log, where [[Mithrix]] throws a worm into a gravity well out of curiosity.
But one day [[Providence]] notices, and [[Providence]] loved worms. This could be seen as the first sign leading to the eventual betrayal at [[A Moment, Fractured]].

`In the worlds without, 
- `Where are their guardians to guide them? 
- `Where will their souls go, in the end? 
- `Why let chaos rule, when power can decide?`

These lines seem to put into question the fates of the residence of planets other than [[Petrichor V]]. This could tie into [[Providence|Providence's]] habit of rescuing the inhabitants of doomed planets.

The final question seems to imply that the author believes the fate of these creatures can be altered through sheer strength.
