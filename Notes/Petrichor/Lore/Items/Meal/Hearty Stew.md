Recipe #0508312765 - Grandma [REDACTED]'s Hearty Stew

Ingredients:
     > 3 liters of water (strained for purity)
     > 3 liters of avocado oil
     > 5 Pounds of Saturnian Bison Beef
     > 5 tablespoons of Flour
     > 5 pounds of assorted vegetables (your choice)
     > 1 box of pasta noodles
     > 1 cup of love

Instructions:
     > Heat the avocado oil at medium-high heat in a large pot. Allow oil to heat up for 3 minutes. Transfer beef into the pot in a single layer and brown for 2 to 3 minutes on both sides, until golden brown crust forms. Place browned beef aside and repeat for remaining beef. Transfer chopped vegetables to pot and sauté until softened for 6 minutes. Once sautéd, stir in flour. Stir well and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add in beef and seasonings. Bring pot to a full boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 1 hour.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log was generated by the [[DataScraper (v3.1.53 - beta branch)]] program.

The log is a recipe for a stew, created by a grandma, though the individual's name has been redacted.

Notably, the recipe includes [[Bison Steak]] as an ingredient, suggesting that this is a recipe created before [[Providence]] moved the [[Bighorn Bison|Bighorn Bisons]] from [[Saturn]] to [[Petrichor V]].

The `1 cup of love`, is obviously a charming touch. However, because the instructions call for seasoning, which is not listed as an ingredient, one could interpret this ingredient to be an assortment of seasonings.

This pickup description mentions the stem making you feel `warm and fuzzy inside`, which suggests it has a very nostalgic flavor.
