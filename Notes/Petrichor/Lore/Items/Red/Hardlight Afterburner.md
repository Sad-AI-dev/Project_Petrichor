Our 'hard light' research has become even more refined since our last correspondence. 

The initial purpose of the afterburner was to function as a primary heatsink for our bigger HL implementations - like our bridges and barriers. However, if attached to a rapidly degrading source, like those we typically dispose, we get a wonderful emission rate of semi-tachyonic particles. In other words... extremely high capacity fueling.

It should be obvious by its design, but to reiterate: stay away from the HL exhaust end when active. The emission method is violent by design, and so should be mounted to static, STABLE sources only.</span>

The item is unstable, and was used in the development of hardlight technology, which can be used to create bridges and barriers.

Take this somewhere PRIVATE before opening. Don't let your wife see, don't even let your kids see. I know you're 'out of the business' but this is the biggest haul we've ever done. They called this thing a 'hard lightburner' or something, and it's suppose to be infinite fuel. I don't know, I couldn't understand them from up in the vents but CAN YOU IMAGINE? Gas prices have been through the roof since the spill in 2040, imagine how much cash you could make just rigging this thing up to your neighborhood for a little somethin'-somethin'! Anyway, they said it was wicked dangerous and to rig it to something stable, so chain it down or something.

This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].

This [[Hardlight Afterburner]] was stolen from the research facility where this experimental energy source was developed.
The sender mentions that gas prices have been extremely high ever since an event in 2040 known as `The Spill`.
The [[Gasoline]] log mentions that the use of gasoline has become fairly rare. This could point towards fossil fuels being rather rare and therefore expensive.
