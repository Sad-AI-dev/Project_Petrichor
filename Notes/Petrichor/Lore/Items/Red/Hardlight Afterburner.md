Our 'hard light' research has become even more refined since our last correspondence. 

The initial purpose of the afterburner was to function as a primary heatsink for our bigger HL implementations - like our bridges and barriers. However, if attached to a rapidly degrading source, like those we typically dispose, we get a wonderful emission rate of semi-tachyonic particles. In other words... extremely high capacity fueling.

It should be obvious by its design, but to reiterate: stay away from the HL exhaust end when active. The emission method is violent by design, and so should be mounted to static, STABLE sources only.</span>

This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].
The item is unstable, and was used in the development of hardlight technology, which can be used to create bridges and barriers.
