Sorry about the delay, we've had a flood of orders come in from this site. But it was exactly where you said we should look - there was a sealed off room where you marked the excavation diagram. I finished translating the engraving too, so consider that a bonus for the time we took to get to it:

"I am the will to survive made manifest. To those who never lose hope, to they who try in the face of impossible odds, I offer not 
protection, but the means to bring one's unconquerable spirit forth as the defender of their mortal lives."

It’s so lightweight, we figure it must've been entirely decorative. That seems to line up with the text. In any case, I hope it makes a good exhibit! I'm a big fan of the museum, so it wouldn't hurt to give me a partner's discount next time I visit, right?</span>

This item is being shipped to [[Titan]].
The item was likely recovered from within ancient ruins on [[Titan]].
The ruins contained the following inscription relating to the item:
```
I am the will to survive made manifest.
To those who never lose hope, to they who try in the face of impossible odds,
I offer not protection, but the means to bring one's unconquerable spirit forth
as the defender of their mortal lives.
```

I interpret this as the item being able to bring out courage within the wielder. This suggests that the item may be supernatural in nature.

Order Details:</span>
Hey boss, in the crate you should find a couple of the artifacts from our last dig in that secret room. You should see 5 items, we stored them in foam. Should be an ornamental shield, some kind of shortsword or dagger, half of a crown, and two shreds of some kind of stiff fabric. Be careful handling the fabric, feels like it could crumble with just slight pressure. The shield must be hollow or something, it's unusually light. I know you are, but be extra careful with it. Don't let the students even breathe on it.

The [[Aegis]] is being shipped as a part of 5 artifacts discovered in a secret room from a dig site. The artifacts are being shipped to a university on [[Titan]].

This log takes place after the log from RoR2, suggesting that the item may have been shipped from the dig site to the museum where they were shipped as a collection to the local university.
(Possibly for further research?)
