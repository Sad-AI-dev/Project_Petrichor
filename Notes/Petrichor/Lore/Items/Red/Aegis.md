Sorry about the delay, we've had a flood of orders come in from this site. But it was exactly where you said we should look - there was a sealed off room where you marked the excavation diagram. I finished translating the engraving too, so consider that a bonus for the time we took to get to it:

"I am the will to survive made manifest. To those who never lose hope, to they who try in the face of impossible odds, I offer not 
protection, but the means to bring one's unconquerable spirit forth as the defender of their mortal lives."

It’s so lightweight, we figure it must've been entirely decorative. That seems to line up with the text. In any case, I hope it makes a good exhibit! I'm a big fan of the museum, so it wouldn't hurt to give me a partner's discount next time I visit, right?</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Titan]].
The item was likely recovered from within ancient ruins on [[Titan]].
The ruins contained the following inscription relating to the item:
```
I am the will to survive made manifest.
To those who never lose hope, to they who try in the face of impossible odds,
I offer not protection, but the means to bring one's unconquerable spirit forth
as the defender of their mortal lives.
```

I interpret this as the item being able to bring out courage within the wielder. This suggests that the item may be supernatural in nature.
