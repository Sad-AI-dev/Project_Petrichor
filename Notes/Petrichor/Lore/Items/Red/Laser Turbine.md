Order Details:</span>
Replacement laser turbine for the photon power plant. The thing is deceptively small, but it holds immense power. Keep it away from all electromagnetic sources; it will charge from the field, and if the capacitor becomes overloaded, it WILL discharge.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Saturn]].

The log mentions a `photon power plant`, which the [[Laser Turbine]] is a replacement part for.
This suggests that high-tech power generators which use light particles to generate power have been invented.

The [[Laser Turbine]] charges from any near electromagnetic sources and will explode aggressively when sufficiently charged.
