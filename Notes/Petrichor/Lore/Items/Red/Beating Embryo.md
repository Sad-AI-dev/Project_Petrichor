Ah. We seem to have found a.. hive of sorts. Without its caretaker, however, most of the eggs seemed to have died off. Must have been caused by our previous specimen.  
KEEP IT REFRIGERATED. You do not want this... beating embryo.. hatching in your care. God knows what will happen.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Venus]].
The address is the same as the address for the [[Super Massive Leech]] and [[Toxic Centipede]].

The embryo is of an alien species which was recently discovered. Unlike most other embryos discovered, this one survived the death of their caretaker.

It is unclear if the `previous specimen` refers to the [[Super Massive Leech]] or [[Toxic Centipede]].
The [[Beating Embryo]] must be kept cold or may hatch.
