Can be used for both night and day shooting, and comes with infrared attachments and built-in distance finder.

...And please, actually use the scope. We are all impressed you can hit a target without it, but I'm tired of watching your videos. Spinning while firing is also a great way to lose your license.

The log is a prequel to the [[Laser Scope]] log.

The log is primarily a funny "no scope" reference.
