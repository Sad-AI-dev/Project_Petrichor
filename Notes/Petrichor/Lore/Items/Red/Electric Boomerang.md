# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">The camp is not well. Blood, thorns and worse litter the area. Days old. He almost made it. He wanders numbly through the wreckage to salvage what he can, eyes empty.
Inside the science vessel Private Gupta finds the roster exceeds the graves he dug. Maybe some escaped. Checking crew quarters, Gupta gasps and rushes up to a mounted metallic boomerang like an old friend.
Hesitating, he pulls it from the wall. He recognizes the signature, his mom’s favorite retired ShockRunner player, ’Joseph Tharson’, of The Volts. His grip tightens as he eases shakily to a knee. Maybe he was meant to survive after all.
