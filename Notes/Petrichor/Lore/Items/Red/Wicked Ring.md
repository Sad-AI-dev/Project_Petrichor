With how many rings he had, you would think more would have been found, eh? Nope, just this one. The King used to sacrifice one of his own sons to embue with dark spirits. He claimed that the spirits warded away any ill omen. The King lived until he was 104, so hey, maybe he was right.  
  
As the last remaining Wicked ring, I expect a hefty sum.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Venus]].

The [[Wicked Ring]] once belonged to an old king, who sacrificed one of sons in order to ward of ill omen. Doing so imbued the son with dark spirits.

The king once had many rings, but only the [[Wicked Ring]] remains.
This king is the same king as the one mentioned on the [[Soulbound Catalyst]] log.
