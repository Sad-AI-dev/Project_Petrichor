Hello - yes, I’d like one of those space plant seeds for the office. I think it would look so nice in here; it'd really brighten up the room, and it could really use it. Al at the Denver branch says he got one, and it's really made a difference. His sales are OFF the charts, and he's contributing all his success to this magic plant!

I've also heard that it sorta gives off a glow that has medical benefits. That would be great for the pain I've been having in my ankle after that run. Might even help the attitude of some of my customers.</span>

FORGET ALOE VERA. THIS IS THE NEXT THING.  
  
> You know how people always have those on their desks? Well this isn't just for the cuts and burns; this makes you feel good EVERYWHERE. Vitamins, proteins, you name it, this plant got it. Takes very little time for it to bear another fruit as well, but it does require some strange potting soil... as in carcasses. Small carcasses.  
  
> ANYWAYS, shoot me an email if you are interested!
