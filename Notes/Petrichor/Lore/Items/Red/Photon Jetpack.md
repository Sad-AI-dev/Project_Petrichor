Here it is, sir. Please just be careful; I'm not quite sure what you are planning, but I don't think the jetpack lasts long enough to fly over to the other office. 77 floors is a long way to fall, sir.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Jupiter]].

Rather comically, the recipient of the [[Photon Jetpack]] intents to use it to fly from the 77th floor of their office to another office building, presumably saving them some time.
