<span class="lore">Shattering Justice Owner’s Manual

Excerpt from section 2.13:
... and if the target material doesn’t cave under the immense weight just keep hitting it until it does. The patented technology inside the face of this tool doesn’t just use brute force to break down its mark, it also utilizes a formulated nano toxin, released through internal mechanisms, that builds up through subsequent contact. In other words, each hit makes it easier to break.

Please refer back to section 1.8 for information on proper handling and the included anti-toxin gloves...</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The item releases nano toxins on impact and requires special anti-toxin gloves to wield.

I'm glad people still use hammers in combat; I find it much more intimate than guns. This thing weighs 5 TONS (yes, TONS), so only your Combat Equipped soldiers can use it. Five tons in a few square feet means that the hammer can crush enemy tanks, EASILY.

This item is being shipped to [[Mars]].

The [[Shattering Justice]] is an incredibly heavy melee weapon. It weights a total of `5 TONS`.
Only `Combat Equipped` individuals would be able to wield this weapon. This suggests that there are a large enough number of people that can easily lift and swing around `5 TONS`. These individuals must make use of some form of technology to allow them to perform such feats.

Notably, melee weapons are still in use. Presumably because gunpowder has fallen out of use and guns don't always deliver enough impact to harm modern technology or dangerous alien wildlife.
