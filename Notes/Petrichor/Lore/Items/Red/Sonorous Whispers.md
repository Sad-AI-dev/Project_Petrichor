# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">A tidepool lapped gently at the silty edge of the grotto.
A soldier clumsy with darkness scrounged for supplies on the shoreline, a broken arm bound in splint and linen.
A small chest is emptied, something stowed in the pocket of the soldier.
A conch next, heavy with silt, he holds it to his ear.
A drip of red trails his neck, stemming from his ear, unnoticed in the dark.
A turn to leave the grotto, he spots a small chest once again sealed.
A soldier empties it once more with a shaking hand.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The Sonorous Whispers is a magical item that somehow allows the survivor mentioned to re-open a chest. Notably, this is different from how the item functions during gameplay.

It appears that the item requires the user to place it to their ear and listen to it, causing their ear to bleed and the magical effect to activate.
