# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">A tidepool lapped gently at the silty edge of the grotto.
A soldier clumsy with darkness scrounged for supplies on the shoreline, a broken arm bound in splint and linen.
A small chest is emptied, something stowed in the pocket of the soldier.
A conch next, heavy with silt, he holds it to his ear.
A drip of red trails his neck, stemming from his ear, unnoticed in the dark.
A turn to leave the grotto, he spots a small chest once again sealed.
A soldier empties it once more with a shaking hand.</span>
