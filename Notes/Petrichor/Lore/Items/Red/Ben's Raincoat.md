Shipping Address: 545 Matthaios Blvd., Gloucester, Earth
Reason For Return: 

The jacket itself is fine, but for some reason, a bunch of the students here got super weird about me wearing it. They keep telling me to take it off because this other guy, Ben, wears a yellow jacket. I guess it's kinda his thing or something.
