Prototype Repulsion Armor; it doesn't quite work as advertised. The protective shielding will activate, but only after... repeated triggers. You'll have to get hit a lot of times before it activates. We have tried increasing the sensitivity, but it lead to the armor triggering from simple movements. We will send an improved prototype next month.
