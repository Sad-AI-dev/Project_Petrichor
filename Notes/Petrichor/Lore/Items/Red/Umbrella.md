# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Earth]].

The formal name of the [[Umbrella]] is `Crossplat Umbrella Infinitive`. The service on this item is awful.

The pickup description is notable. `They fear the rain` is vague, but could be in reference to the [[UES Contact Light]] and how it's cargo scattering across the surface of [[Petrichor V]] resembled rain. Potentially, this description shows how the inhabitants felt great fear as the cargo rained down.
