Very interesting sample. Found in the egg of an indigenous species in Sector 13. It undergoes mitosis that we all know, but at a much faster rate; about 2140x faster. Obviously can be useful for medicinal purposes.  
  
Make sure to follow the instructions included to keep the sample alive. We have sent it frozen to stop the rapid duplications; since it increases in cell count exponentially, it could very well spiral out of control otherwise.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being send to a space station somewhere in the `Saury Cosmo`.

The [[Rapid Mitosis]] is a biological sample containing the eggs of a species indigenous to `Sector 13`, presumably a sector of outer space.

A unique property of the [[Rapid Mitosis]] is, much like the name suggests, the incredible speed at which the cells duplicate themselves. The sender hopes studying this may yield insights that could advance medical sciences.
