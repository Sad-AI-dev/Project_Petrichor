With the insane temperatures of your condition, it has come to our attention that you would probably want the strongest flame-retardent equipment. Well here it is; it works literally 'fighting fire with fire.'  
  
It dispenses fluids that burn at low-temperature, which consumes large amounts of oxygen. This should starve any high-burning flames nearby, but obviously will leave a flaming trail behind you. Don't use outside the correct conditions, or you will burn your house down.  
Can be refilled with gasoline, kerosene, or really anything that burns decently.
