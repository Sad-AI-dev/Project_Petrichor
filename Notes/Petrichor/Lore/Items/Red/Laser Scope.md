Shipping Details:

An improved model compared to my last shipment, this one has all the perks of the last model PLUS a fancy new laser pointer to help improve aim.

And, knowing you, it can blind your targets when you do those fancy acrobatics prior to firing. I gotta admit, that last video was pretty cool... Just don't let the union find out about it. You'll lose more than your license if they catch you playing with this.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>

The log is a direct continuation from the [[Telescopic Sight]] item.

A license is required to carry or use firearms, and irresponsible use may cause this license to be revoked by "the union".
