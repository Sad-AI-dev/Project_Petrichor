Shipping Details:

Contained in this shipment should be a variety of biopsy samples from our late Mr. Jefferson. As you know, he was an extraordinary man in almost any manner. He was athletic, brilliant, kind, funny, and an all-around great human specimen. 

He donated his body to science, and as we began the operation we found a most terrifying discovery.

A quick visual examination of the subject’s brain shows a very… particular oddity. It seems to be housing a variety of… glowing brain “stalks”, similar to tubeworms. Trying to biopsy the stalks is impossible - they seem to disintegrate into dust the moment we remove it from the brain. We cannot explain this oddity at all. As such, we have included the entire brain in this shipment.

Please let us know if you find any explanation.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
It is unclear where this item is being shipped.

The brain once belonged to [[Mr. Jefferson]], a generally great person.
The brain stalks themselves may be supernatural in nature.
