Order Details:</span>
Contains about 500 horse power of torque. Diamond tipped and coated, along with composite steel. Strong enough to pierce the most heavenly of materials.  
Can be used for manual drilling, or swap to laser-mode to fire a mining laser instead. The former will wear it out much quicker, but will also have better results.  
  
Why I bother telling you all this is beyond me. You people aren't planning on using it for mining anyways.
