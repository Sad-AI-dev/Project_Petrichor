<span class="lore">“Lasers have their speed. Swords have their edge. Gases have their reach. 

But let me tell you... Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, is as timeless as gunpowder. Just a pinch - jammed into a tight enough socket - and KABOOM! You got yourself not just a powerful weapon, but something that’ll leave a lasting sense of fear in your enemies. I mean, nobody wants to be blown up, right?”

The log reveals the widespread existence of lasers, and how they are superior to traditional weapons when it comes to speed.
