# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">“Lasers have their speed. Swords have their edge. Gases have their reach. 

But let me tell you... Nothing, and I mean NOTHING, is as timeless as gunpowder. Just a pinch - jammed into a tight enough socket - and KABOOM! You got yourself not just a powerful weapon, but something that’ll leave a lasting sense of fear in your enemies. I mean, nobody wants to be blown up, right?”

- Autobiography of Jans Czar, Modern King of Weaponry</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The log is a quote from [[Jans Czar]].

The log reveals the widespread existence of lasers, and how they are superior to traditional weapons when it comes to speed.
But gunpowder has a unique intimidation factor that has remained timeless.

Pristine condition from the War of Slopes, 2019. All genuine and a real good collector's item!  
  
She still works, but I would -not- try to fire it. Requires blackpowder which is expensive enough as is, but she makes a loud bang!  
Selling for $200,000 starting. Send it back or I'll have my boys over.
