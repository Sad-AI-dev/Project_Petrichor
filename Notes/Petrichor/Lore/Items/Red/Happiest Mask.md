# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is a recording from [[Rallypoint Delta]]. 
The survivors have recovered a magical item from the wreckage of the [[UES Contact Light]].

The mask has caused ghosts of recently defeated [[Lemurian|Lemurians]], [[Beetle|Beetles]] and [[Imp|Imps]] to appear.
It appears that the mask allows the wearer to command these ghosts.
