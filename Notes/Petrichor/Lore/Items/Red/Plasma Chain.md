Hey there, my wife and I am returning a lost plasma chain. It is still fully operational and can haul my spaceship easily, so we expect the full reward!  
  
We found it in an unmarked cave with a very large claw wrapped around it. The serial number should tell you the previous owner; the finder's fee can be sent to the same account that I'm sending this message from. Thank you.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Jupiter]].

The [[Plasma Chain]] was discovered in an unmarked cave with large claw wrapped around it.
The intended use of the [[Plasma Chain]] is effectively a grappling hook that can pull incredibly heavy objects, such as a spaceship.

The [[Plasma Chain]] is being returned to `Mg.Sys Inc`, which is presumably the shortened name of the manufacturer. There is a finder's fee for returning the item (or at least the sender believes so).
