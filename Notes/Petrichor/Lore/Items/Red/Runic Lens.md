# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to [[Mercury]] and is apparently ~30 years late.
The log is an appraisal report, created by `Kosta`, who works at the [[Crumbling Tower]], on [[Venus]].

The report reveals that touching the item is unwise, and avoiding eye contact with it is advised. It appears to be able to summon meteors near the wielder. The item is highly magical in nature.
