LARGE, OF OUR RESTING BONES

I PULL FROM DEEP FERTILE SOIL.

I COAT IT IN A ROYAL GLAND - THIS IS FOR GROWTH.

I GIVE IT RED LENSES - THESE ARE FOR PRECISION

I STEEP IN SHINING NECTAR - THIS IS FOR ASCENSION.

STAND AND BE WELCOME, FIRST DAUGHTER OF PARADISE.

LET US SHOW YOU OUR GARDEN.

AND YOU WILL SHOW US HOW TO PROTECT IT.

TO THE COLONY THE SEED, TO US THE NECTAR.</span>
