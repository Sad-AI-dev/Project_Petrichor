<span class="lore">The one planet they couldn't take.

They had everything locked away in their cells.

Beasts, artifacts of power, gods, memories.

And yet, no matter how many agents they sent, none returned victorious... if they returned at all.

The lucky ones who did survive fled, nervously whispering of a crystalline blade stained with chaos.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log shows the perspective of [[The Void]]. It comments on how [[Petrichor V]] was the only planet they couldn't detain in their cells.

It shows how [[The Void]] has previously placed beasts, artifacts of power, gods and memories in their cells. The only individuals confirmed to have been detained by the void are [[Acrid]] and [[Void Fiend]].

The log reveals that it was [[Providence]] who prevented [[The Void]] from taking [[Petrichor V]].

It is mentioned that [[Providence|Providence's]] weapon was `stained with chaos`. It is unclear what this refers to or how this may potentially related to the Bottled Chaos Item.

This horrid bottle fills me with fear. I can see the reflections in the glass of things that are not there. My psychologist sees nothing in the bottle, but through the glass her face looks distorted beyond my understanding. I can't carry it anymore, I'm sorry. It's been only three days but I can't sleep with the sound of clacking and rattling occupying my dreams. Give it to someone else for safekeeping, I don't care about the job.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
It appears that the [[Bottled Chaos]] is being returned to sender. Specifically, the individual who took the job of keeping the [[Bottled Chaos]] safe no longer wants it and no longer cares about the job.

The holder sees visions that are distorted through the glass. A clacking and rattling occupy their dreams.

The [[Bottled Chaos]] is likely magical in nature.
