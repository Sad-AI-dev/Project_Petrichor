<span class="lore">The one planet they couldn't take.

They had everything locked away in their cells.

Beasts, artifacts of power, gods, memories.

And yet, no matter how many agents they sent, none returned victorious... if they returned at all.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log shows the perspective of [[The Void]]. It comments on how [[Petrichor V]] was the only planet they couldn't detain in their cells.

It shows how [[The Void]] has previously placed beasts, artifacts of power, gods and memories in their cells. The only individuals confirmed to have been detained by the void are [[Acrid]] and [[Void Fiend]].

The log reveals that it was [[Providence]] who prevented [[The Void]] from taking [[Petrichor V]].

It is mentioned that [[Providence|Providence's]] weapon was `stained with chaos`. It is unclear what this refers to or how this may potentially related to the Bottled Chaos Item.
