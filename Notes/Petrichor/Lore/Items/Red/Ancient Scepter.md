Order Details:</span>
A glowing scepter, with a name engraved in the handle. I can't read with it says; I was hoping you could decipher it. It must have some magical powers; look at how impressive it is! It's much better than your Lance of Legends, that's for sure.  
  
And before you ask, yes, the handle is supposed to be hard to hold. Culls the weak.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This item is being shipped to the [[Crumbling Tower]] on [[Venus]].
The estimated delivery date is rather nonsensical.

The item is a reference to `Dota 2`. The mentioned `Lance of Legends` is a `League of Legends` reference.
Once again this log shows how the [[Crumbling Tower]] is heavily connected to magical objects.
Additionally, the [[Ancient Scepter]] is intentionally hard to hold.
