<span class="lore">Fossils. Remnants. How cruel. 

This moon once housed life. Life that you may have held dear, had the timing been right. But our timing was wrong. We were born much too late.

Now, it is just calcium to me – and irrelevant to you. Isn’t that right?</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is a monologue spoken by [[Mithrix]] addressed to [[Providence]].

It is revealed that the moon of [[Commencement]] once housed life, and that the [[Gesture of the Drowned]] are fossils found there.

[[Mithrix]] call out how he views such fossils as their base components: calcium, but to [[Providence]] they are dead, and therefore irrelevant. Pointing out the hypocrisy in his behavior, only caring for the select living few he has selected.
