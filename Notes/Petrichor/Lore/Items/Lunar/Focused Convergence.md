<span class="lore">Gravity concentrating... falling inward, condensing, hardening.

A singularity shrinks to the point your mind inverts, reversing reality. Now return. 

Don’t the matters of the physical world seem trivial now? Your tasks in this realm are simple and hastened, all in an attempt to get reversed. How many times can you make this trip before you are claimed by its process? 

Do not let it take you. Take it instead. Here.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The [[Focused Convergence]] seems to be a powerful artifact that relates to highly concentrated gravity, potentially referring to a black hole.

The device seems to be able to allow the wielder to take advantage of some kind of reversing process of reality.

It is unclear who created this device, who is speaking in this log, or who this individual is speaking to.
