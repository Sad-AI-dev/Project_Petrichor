# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log was generated by the [[MyBabel Machine Translator]].

The log seems to show a series of experiments held by [[Mithrix]] and his followers.

`Grix`, `Ouju` and `Rhisko` are all names of followers who are burnt during the experiments.
The mention of `Black ichor` from `Ouju` suggests that `Ouju` is not a construct, but rather a living being.

The final measurement is performed by [[Mithrix]], who concludes that the mixture has been perfected.
