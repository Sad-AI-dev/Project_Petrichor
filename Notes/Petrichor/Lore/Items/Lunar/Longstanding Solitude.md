<span class="lore">Day 1
The chilly coin in my pocket hums softly, drawing me off path. A pulsing blue pod is lodged in the earth here, covered in morning frost. Even through gloves, the coin burns colder than ever. I’m terrified and compelled to place the coin on the pod, it snaps open.
A dark gel oozes out, carrying a round device and tablet to my feet. The device activates and pulls the tablet with it into a hover. A construct? I know I should have shot it down, but I… feel it wants to help me get stronger.
I touch the construct. Thousands of years push their way into my skull, the mounting pressure makes me howl in a voice I don’t recognize, then nothing.
---
A pounding migraine wakes me. Midday. I feel moss under me and shield my eyes against the canopy light. I am closer to RallyPoint, but how? Disfigured beetles lay dead in a radius around me, faces distorted, limbs bent. I vomit. The construct hovers protectively nearby. How did it do this?
Day 2
Studying the tablet brings no comfort. I worry about Huang. The isolation grates on me, I’m exhausted, hungry, angry. I finally found a supply chest but the construct absorbed my coin before I could use it. This lowly thing thinks it knows best. I don’t know what came over me but I attacked the construct. It didn’t seem to mind but that only made me feel worse. I am not myself.
Day 3
The full moon’s light makes me itch. It pursues me from it’s dark sea, sluggish and unnerving. I stare into it, nearly falling into it’s gaze. For hours I run terrified in the wrong direction. I cannot face it, not how I am. Under a deep canopy I draw familiar power from the construct. Inky feathers break through the skin of my arms and hands. I black out.
Day 4
That blasted thing isn’t cheap, the construct is obsessed with coin, but I can’t argue with the results. The Lemurians barely put up a fight, obliterated, distracted by their song.
The last one drops from my talons.
They never should have been here in the first place. Where they are blind, I see the shapes of things and truly know them. I must reach…someone, somewhere. I cannot quite remember.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is written in the style of a diary by a survivor on [[Petrichor V]].

The survivor comes across a Lunar coin, and uses it to open a Lunar pod. The survivor finds a [[Longstanding Solitude]] inside, which starts to follow the survivor.
The Lunar coin is cold to the touch. This sensation increases as the holder approaches objects which the coin can be "spent" on.
Lunar pods contain a dark gel along a Lunar item, which oozes out when the pod is opened.

Touching the [[Longstanding Solitude]] results in a sensation of thousands of years pushing their way into the holder's skull.
Additionally, touching results into the holder falling unconscious. While unconscious, something takes control of the body, resulting in the host waking up hours later, in a different location. It seems that members of the [[Beetle Family]] still recognize the possessed survivor as a threat, and the possessing entity is plenty capable of defending itself.

It seems like the survivor was based at a location referred to as "RallyPoint". This is likely in reference to a location similar to [[Rallypoint Delta]], but the moss seen by the survivor suggests a warmer climate, indicating that this is likely referring to another RallyPoint.
The survivor worries about an individual referred to as [[Huang]].

[[Longstanding Solitude]], much like during gameplay, absorbs all currency held by the survivor, preventing them from opening security chests.

Prolonged exposure to the [[Longstanding Solitude]] causes one to develop an inherent connection to the moon of [[Commencement]], likely due to this being the location where [[Mithrix]], the creator of the lunar items, resides.
Additionally, it seems like the survivor is slowly turning into the form of an [[Alloy Vulture]]. This may relate to the appearance of the [[Heretic]].

The culture of the [[Lemurian Family]] including dances is once again mentioned.

The transformation allows the survivor to truly understand the things they see, as they start to recall a false memory of needing to reach [[Mithrix]].

Ultimately, the survivor's capacity for speech starts to deteriorate, but it does seem the false memory becomes much clearer to them. 
The rats gathering in the brother's shadow references [[Mithrix]] being on the moon of [[Commencement]], that [[Petrichor V]] is within his grasp, and that "Vermin" are gathering on [[Petrichor V]].
It seems the result of the transformation is the survivor fully becoming a follower of [[Mithrix]], enacting his will without truly understanding why or for whom they act.
