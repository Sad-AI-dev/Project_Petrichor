<span class="lore">...I know you can hear me.

I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, at first. Perhaps there was a flaw in my design.

Perhaps it was one of your games. I was even willing to forgive you.

But no, I see the truth now. You trapped me on this forsaken rock. And for what? 

Is this all for your little pets? The creatures you love so much?

Or, can I even call it love, when you would stab your only brother in the back? How could you do this to me?

I, the only one who looked out for you after her death.

I, the one who showed you how to create?

I, who HELPED to CREATE the very power you use to invite VERMIN and PESTS to our home?

I, YOUR ONLY BROTHER?

HOW COULD YOU LOVE THOSE IMPERFECT, FLAWED VERMIN BUT NOT ME? AFTER ALL I'VE DONE FOR YOU? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is a monologue spoken by [[Mithrix]], which is directed at [[Providence]].

The log takes place some time after [[Mithrix]] was banished to the moon of [[Commencement]], as seen in the [[A Moment, Fractured]] log.

The log gives insight into how [[Mithrix]] felt after the betrayal, believing it may have been an accident of some sore, or a prank.

[[Mithrix]] believes [[Providence|Providence's]] motivation for doing this to him was related to the creatures he invited to [[Petrichor V]].

It is revealed that [[Mithrix]] took care of [[Providence]] after [[She]] died, suggesting that [[Providence]] took [[She|Her]] death quite poorly.
Additionally, [[Mithrix]] showed [[Providence]] how to create.

[[Mithrix]] created the power [[Providence]] uses to invite dying races to [[Petrichor V]].

This being the log for [[Egocentrism]] suggests that these views are entirely [[Mithrix|Mithrix's]] and may not be entirely accurate.
