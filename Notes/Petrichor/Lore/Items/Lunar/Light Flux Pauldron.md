# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">"The wind guides us all. Listen to the song of the wind, and dance according to its instruction. You will find yourself dodging every blow, countering every strike. You will find that the wind will lift you up, making you as free as a fallen autumn leaf. But heed, and do not lose yourself to the wind. Running is a viable option, though eventually you will find yourself with nowhere left to run to."

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is an excerpt from the [[Will of Combat]].

This log seems to somewhat contradict the [[Stone Flux Pauldron]] log, suggesting that one should flow like the wind, dodging strikes and avoiding combat when possible.

It does make sure to point out that only running away is not a valid strategy, you'll end up with nowhere left to run.
