<span class="lore">Mass.

Simple, featureless, and bland. But required.

We take mass, and bring it into being.

Space-time bends around mass. We call this gravity.

The more mass, the stronger the pull of gravity.

Lesser beings may buckle under the weight. Even light may succumb to mass's pull.

Fascinating.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is likely spoken by [[Mithrix]], as he discusses the properties of one of the four primary elements: Mass.

He speaks of how mass bands space, and how this can even pull in light, creating a black hole.

This suggests that the [[Neutronium Weight]] is fairly close to the base principle of Mass. The spikes seen on the item resembles those seen on [[Mithrix]] during the final phase of his fight, as well as in various other locations, suggesting a possible connection between these crystal growths and the primary element of Mass.
