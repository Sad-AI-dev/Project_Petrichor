# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">What a... peculiar piece of the stars that serendipity has brought us. I'm sure you can make more. The ratios are simple. It should be quite fun.</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This seems to be said by [[Mithrix]]. The mention of `ratios` suggests he is likely speaking to [[Providence]].

The item originates from a star, and seems to be a smaller strange piece of one.

It *is* quite fun.
