<span class="lore">Excerpt from the folk tale “Hymn of Aphocles”:

“...The statue had been carved to the artist’s creative vision. Beautiful and powerful, its mighty marble visage shone as radiantly as the moon. However, the common folk did not share the artist’s vision. Declaring the statue imperfect, a single laborer took up his gouge and defiled the work, shaping it to his own selfish ideas of beauty.

Admiring his own work, the laborer confidently claimed that he had increased the beauty of the art tenfold. However, the artist did not hear these words. The artist felt only rage, rage at the laborer who had defiled his masterpiece, and rage at the common folk who lauded the laborer as a hero.

And just as the laborer did not recognize the beauty of the untouched statue, so too did the laborer fail to recognize the shards of marble constricting around his leg.”</span>
# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The log is an excerpt from the folk tale [[Hymn of Aphocles]].

The story reflects that of [[Mithrix]] and [[Providence]]. The statue is an allegory to [[Petrichor V]], which [[Mithrix]] had designed to his creative vision.
However, the inhabitants of [[Petrichor V]] did not share this vision, as [[Mithrix]] isn't known for his compassion. Thus, [[Providence]] started to alter [[Petrichor V]], in the interest of making it a better place for the inhabitants, which leads to him becoming a beloved figure.

However, [[Mithrix]] couldn't see past the defilement of his masterpiece, feeling rage towards the inhabitants. Notably, this suggests that [[Mithrix]] did not harbor his rage towards [[Providence]], but instead to the "vermin" that now find themselves on his planet.

Ultimately, this leads to the shattering of the relationship the two brothers once shared.
The shards of marble constricting around [[Providence|Providence's]] leg could be in reference to him becoming bound to his duties to care for the inhabitants of [[Petrichor V]], whom he had saved in an act of kindness and compassion. Alternatively, this could be in reference to [[Providence]] not immediately realizing how this choice would end with him banishing [[Mithrix]] to the moon of [[Commencement]].
