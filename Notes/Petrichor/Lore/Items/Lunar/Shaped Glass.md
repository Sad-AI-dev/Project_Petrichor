Unstructured glass, from the heart of the [Moon]. Sung out, in ethereal wisps, over the course of 3 cycles. Pause.

We fold time into its material - twice. Our time and &lthis>. A cost &lthe> was willing us to pay. Folded and shaped, with a god's designs.
 
&ltHe> wields it, in one of many great hands. The time we injected is unfolded in &lthis> grasp. Outputs quicken - muscles compress twice. Twice as many intentions. Twice the ordered complexities, folded upon themselves. Loops loop back onto [?] in pairs. Time dependent functions. Pause.

&ltHe> sunders a construct into a thousand pieces.

But time is fair. Microtears begin to uncoil in pairs. Muscles begin to snap, twice as fast. The cost of folded time. But &lthe> has plenty of time.

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is a translation generated by the [[MyBabel Machine Translator]].

The log shows how the [[Shaped Glass]] was made by [[Mithrix]]. The material used to create the [[Shaped Glass]] originates from the core of the moon of [[Commencement]].

The log refers to `Our time and <his>`. the `his` is in reference to [[Mithrix]], but it is unclear who `Our` refers to in this context.

The [[Shaped Glass]] allows the holder to take advantage of `folded time`, which allows them to act more, become stronger and faster, but using this power takes a heavy toll on the wielder.
