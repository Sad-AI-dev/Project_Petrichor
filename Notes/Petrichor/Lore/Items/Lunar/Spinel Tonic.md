# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">“Reality is whatever the mind decides it to be. Take a sip of the drink, and the mind becomes malleable. From there, you can shape it into whatever form you please... and the world around you follows your example.”

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
The log is a quote from [[Sigibold the Drunken]].

The log suggests that the tonic somehow has the ability to reshape the world based on the consumer's perceptions. It is highly likely the tonic also warps those perceptions.
