# <span class="lore-title-inline">Lore</span>
<span class="lore">“The original information super-highway: the spine. A strait-laced path from the body to the brain, it is responsible for ensuring the survival of all life. However, its limitations involve being localized to its parent body. What if - just like the development of the inter-computer wireless network - one’s nervous system could communicate with another? What if the spine traced a path not just from body to mind, but a path that intersects between other bodies and minds?”

# <span class="lore-title-inline">Notes</span>
This log is a note from [[Job Michaels]].

The log sketches an image of the spine as an information highway, and suggest the potential of direct communication between spines.
The concept is likely not based on any scientific concepts.

It is unclear how the log relates to the item, or how this relates to the Lunar nature of the item.

The name [[Mercurial Rachis]] suggests that the item may be somewhat related to the planet [[Mercury]], or the metal.
