Welcome to Project Petrichor!
Project Petrichor aims to map out all the lore present in the log book entries from both `Risk of Rain 2` and `Risk of Rain Returns`.

# Main Pages

# [[Lore Reference]]


# Notes
The ultimate goal of the Project Petrichor is to create a TTRPG setting based on the Risk of Rain universe.
The first step to achieve this is to create a database for everything currently known about the Risk of Rain universe. Specifically by examining all the logbook entries presented in `Risk of Rain 2` and `Risk of Rain Returns` in addition to any relevant gameplay details from these titles.

Notably, the goal is not necessarily for the lore to be comprehensive, 
but rather for it to be "*complete*".
Ideally, the final products would serve as the ideal resource to formulate a comprehensive understanding from.

**A Note on Cut Content**
Generally, cut content will *not* be considered cannon. 
However, this content can provide insight into the developer's plans for the lore of underexplored areas of the universe. 
Therefore, on occasion, cut content will be referenced as a source to support elements present in released content.
When this is relevant, it will be explicitly stated on the page.
